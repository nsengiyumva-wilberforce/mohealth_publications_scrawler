Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report The development of the Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report for the Financial Year (FY) 2023/24 was led by the Medicines (DPNM).
"A special acknowledgment is due to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for their generous financial support, which made the development of this report possible."
Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report The Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report 2023/24 reviews the progress made towards achieving the targets set in the National Pharmaceutical Services Strategic Plan (NPSSP) Progress is assessed by examining the trends in the 32 selected indicators over time and comparing them to set targets.
The report covers eleven  priority areas of the NPSSP which are aligned with the objectives in the National Medicines Policy 2015.
"Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report The data collection process was in accordance with the standard and approved procedures, methods, and tools outlined in the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan for the NPSSP."
"The data is collected on an annual basis, analyzed, and reported by the Governance, Leadership, and Pharmaceutical Information Portal (PIP), Medicines Procurement and Management (MPM) Technical Working Group (TWG), CSG, 10-year supply and Management Structures: Implementation NMS and JMS issues and stock on hand (SOH) reports, HMIS 105 reports, SPARS Reports, Warehouse online stock status report (OSSR), online facility stock status report (OFSSR), NMS CSSP, JMS integrated ordering system."
Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report The indicators selected were based on the priority strategies outlined in the NPSSP.
"To ensure standardized measurements, operational definitions were clearly defined for each indicator, with the data source, collection and calculation method, and data limitations described in the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) plan."
"Where indicators can be measured through more than one source of data, these are presented together for the purpose of comparison and validation."
Data was entered into STATA and different Excel workbooks and cleaned to ensure errors were corrected.
Descriptive statistics for each indicator were generated.
The focus of the analysis was the current performance compared to the previous years performance and set targets.
"This report is disseminated through the Ministerial policy statement and budget framework paper, NMS vote 116 health facility resource allocations, Integrated quantification report for essential medicines and health supplies, FY 2023//26 Pharmaceutical Management Pharmaceutical Information Portal, Multi-sectoral Collaboration and Research, Development, and"

Leadership Capacity Building Physical and online meetings In collaboration with the of the training was to strengthen health supply chain leadership and governance coordination mechanisms through existing structures and decision-making organs to improve Health Supply Chain (HSC) performance in local governments and health facilities.
"The training meetings were guided by the six  HSC leadership, management, and governance modules through a structured training and mentorship approach, namely,  overview of HSC management,  principles of governance,  action-oriented leadership,  strategic planning, budgeting, and financing of HSC,  HSC policy development and implementation,  overview of drivers of change."
"Overall, there has been an improvement in performance across the accreditation criteria for all referral for Mulago NRH, as illustrated in chain TWGs, Co. E-accredited management Hub & Spoke model."
"The SDP may be a static facility, a community health outreach post, or a household."
H DPNM has implemented several strategies to promote last mile assurance.
"Health Commodity Accountability including the National Malaria Control Division (NMCD), AIDS Control Program (ACP), and the Reproductive and Infant (R&I) and the NMS Client Self Services Portal (CSSP) to establish the extent to which health facilities are accounting for health commodities."
"For malaria Commodities, morbidity and diagnosis data from DHIS2 was compared with malaria commodity supply data from NMS to health facilities for FY 2022/2023."
"For Family Planning, HIV, and Laboratory commodities; expected stock on hand (SOH) estimated as opening balance plus quantity received plus adjustments, less consumption data and losses, was compared with reported closing balance (COB) for each of the cycles one () to five ()."
The potentially unaccounted for commodities/funds for each health facility were aggregated to estimate the total volume/value for each of the 136 districts.
Data for the 10 cities was considered under each of the parent districts.
"Although positions for HC4, resource structure, many districts have been reluctant to recruit for these roles, citing inadequate funding."
"This has likely contributed to accountability challenges for health commodities, as one of the key responsibilities of a health facility or district Pharmacist is to ensure proper accountability 3.1.4.2."
"Accountability was tracked using stock cards, requisition and issue vouchers, as well as dispensing and laboratory registers."
"However, the highest discrepancies were observed in combined cycle deliveries."
"To address this, NMS combined distribution cycles to align with the Although health facilities are using accountability tools, challenges persist at dispensing units, where some facilities struggle to complete daily and monthly summaries of dispensed medicines and health supplies."
"To improve facility performance, a multipronged approach is needed, including on-site training, mentorship, intensified supervision by District Health Teams, self-audits by health facility staff, and involvement of Local Government Leaders in reconciliation and accountability efforts."
"Additionally, the rollout of Electronic Logistics Management Information Systems (e. LMIS) should be fast-tracked and prioritized to enhance accountability and tracking of health commodities."
An in-depth spot-check assessment was done for reproductive health commodities.
"The value of sampled health commodities delivered was $.08, which is equivalent to 90% of the total value of UNFPA programme supplies delivered to the Mo."
NMS and JMS warehouses were adequately equipped and maintained the storage of health supplies.
"However, the storage infrastructure at 7 out of 12 sampled Service Delivery Points (SDPs) was not in good condition due to budgetary constraints which inhibited regular maintenance and purchase of store equipment."
Eleven  out of the 14 sampled facilities had maintained inventory records and the supplies received were recorded in stock cards.
Syringes 1ml were observed to be overstocked at seven  health facilities because Depo Provera was issued without the syringes during interfacility transfers.
"Jadelle, Implanon NXT and Depo Provera were found to be overstocked across 3 out of 12 service delivery points (SDPs)."
"Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report Health Commodity Ordering and reporting Health facilities place routine orders for health commodities based on a defined annual ordering schedule, which is developed and disseminated by NMS and JMS to the public and PNFP/PFP health facilities respectively."
H approved order and report templates and systems are used to place orders.
"To address this challenge, the warehouse-integrated ordering system was introduced, extending the warehouse Enterprise Resource Platform (ERP) to include the client service portal."
Late orders are automatically locked out unless an extension is formally authorized.
"Each health facility is required to order specific health commodity categories based on its accreditation and service level, following the one facility, one warehouse policy, as per the ordering schedule developed and shared by the warehouse."
"These categories include Essential Medicines and Health Supplies (EMHS, commonly referred to as the credit line), HIV Test Kits, Laboratory supplies, Tuberculosis (TB) medicines, Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB medicines, and Reproductive Health To ensure that all required orders from a health facility are placed within a particular order cycle, tracking is based on the different commodity categories."
Order rate performance is measured by the timely submission of complete order sets.
"As such, ordering rate performance is defined as the number of facilities that submitted the expected complete order sets within each order cycle."
"Public health facilities commodity ordering using NMS+ CSSP National Medical Stores is mandated to procure, store and distribute EMHS to all public health facilities within the country, including Army, Police and Prisons health facilities."
"NMS serves over public health facilities at various levels of care, with over  being Health Center IIIs and above, while the rest are Health Center IIs."
The average ordering rate using NMS+ CSSP for both lower and higher-level public health facilities has been sustained at >95% in FY 2023/24 for program and nonprogram commodities across the six order cycles as shown in
"The system was rolled out in , enhancing an integrated approach to ordering, order consolidation, fulfillment, tracking, and analytics."
"All commodity orders for Cycle 4, 5 & for Antiretrovirals (ARVs), anti-malarials, Test Kits, Laboratory supplies, Reproductive Health commodities, Anti-Tuberculosis commodities, and others were submitted through the JMS-IOS."
"These were achieved through system development, training of  participants from 140 districts/ cities, and system account creation."
Vaccine ordering Vaccine orders were submitted by all 136 districts during .
Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report Order fill rate refers to the extent to which health facility order lines are filled by the respective warehouse(s) in a given ordering period.
Public Sector (NMS performance) The delivery of health commodities is based on published monthly or bimonthly schedules.
"Quantity of commodities delivered is informed by procurement plan, orders, and availability of commodities at the warehouse."
"In Q4 of FY 2023/24, the average lead time for routine bimonthly orders in the public sector was 60 days compared to 30 days in the PNFP sector."
The increase in lead time in the public sector was due to delays arising from the delay of release of operational funds from (Mo.
The cut-offs were determined based on the severe malaria cases submitted into DHIS2.
"However, due to DHIS2 downtime, reporting was affected in the REPORTING IN FY 2023/243.2.3.2."
Health facility availability The average availability of a basket of 41 tracer commodities in the last quarter of FY 2023/24 was 64% for  functional reporting health facilities (public & PNFPs) that reported (refer to This was below the annual target of 90% and an increase of 6 percentage points compared with the last quarter of FY 2022/23 which was 58%.
"ART regimen optimization (change of first line regimens) affected reporting from health facilities, because optimized regimens were not incorporated into the routine data collection tools."
"The tracer ARVs that were being tracked cover only a small section of ART Clients and the others are obsolete, which essentially affected the availability of ARVs."
"Central Level Warehouse Availability The overall availability of supplies for a basket of 41 Commodities and health supplies at Central Level Warehouses (NMS and JMS) was 70%, which was below the target of 80% (refer to QUARTER IN FY 2023/243.2.5."
These interventions are aimed at addressing product expiry and wastage.
"The graph was split into two ( 13), basing on the value of expiries."
"Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report During the last quarter of the year, , commodity expiry decreased by 40% and 51% for ARVs and EMHS respectively, however it was still high compared to other commodity baskets namely TB, RMNCAH, and Laboratory."
This is attributed to the transition from obsolete to optimal regimens.
H is strengthening the capacity of 22 National/Regional Referral plans.
Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report have had at least four assessments and two (10%) have had three assessments.
"Mulago NRH is the only facility that has not reached the 80% score in pharmaceutical waste management, mainly because there were accumulated expired commodities that were not yet disposed of at the time of the third assessment."
Follow-ups are ongoing to have them address this concern.
USAID/SSCS activity continues to work with the facilities to improve their waste management plans.
Stock Management Performance Good stock management practices are the cornerstone of efficient and effective healthcare delivery at health facilities.
"Ensuring the availability of essential medicines and supplies, while minimizing waste and losses is crucial for meeting patient needs and optimizing resource utilization."
Stock management indicators are tracked under the Essential Medicines Supervision Performance Assessment and Recognition Strategy (SPARS).
"The average stock management score for FY 2023/24 was 3.24/5 (64.8%), which is below the target of Additionally, there are other methods/approaches used to supplement SPARS including Pre-Joint Review supervisions, support supervisions and mentorships etc., though the data for these could Digital Supply Chain Performance Self-Assessment The Digital Supply Chain Performance Self-Assessment (DSPSS) portal accessible via health.go.ug/, is a platform for health facility supply chain managers/staff to assess the health facility supply chain performance, without need for presence of external supervisors."
H e-learning platform ( health workers enroll to the e-learning supply chain management course to improve their knowledge in the domains where they score low on the assessments.
"H is committed to attaining and maintaining an adequate pharmaceutical services workforce that is equitably distributed, appropriately skilled, motivated, and productive."
"Over the years, there has been an increase in the number of training institutions and schools which has led to an increase in the number of pharmacy professionals."
"Currently, three  universities are offering pharmacy education at bachelors and post-graduate levels."
"There are several institutions training pharmacy technicians (dispensers) and pharmacy assistants at diploma and certificate A review of the human resource structure for public health facilities, that included the introduction of new pharmacist positions at referral, district, general"
Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report Senior Consultant (Oncology Consultant (Oncology Pharmacist) Consultant (Radio pharmacy) MO Special Grade (Oncology Pharmaceutical Sector Workforce Various indicators are used to track progress in building the pharmaceutical sector workforce.
"Training of Human Resources for the Pharmaceutical Services To temporarily address the severe shortage of qualified pharmaceutical staff in both the public and PNFP health sectors, other healthcare cadres have been assigned specific roles to manage essential medicines and health supplies at various levels of care."
This parameter is established by dividing the number of health products and technologies that have failed post-market quality test by the total number of health products and technologies sampled multiplied by 100.
"Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report There has been a general decline in the failure rate since FY 20/21, dropping from 16% to 12% in FY 23/24."
"Strategic Document Development and Review A total of five  strategic documents were developed, 15 were reviewed, and five  were operationalized in the FY 2023/24, as outlined in Guidelines for regulation 2."
Prescribing quality is measured by four subindicators i.e.
FY 2023/24 performance is highlighted in Number of antibiotics prescribed per Prescription by generic name Adherence to standard treatment guidelines 3.5.2.
"From  to , a total of  health-care professionals were mentored."
"In addition, two technical committees at the National level focused on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and antimicrobial use (AMU) were revitalized."
H with support from partners conducted a national assessment of PPS in all public focus was on all patients prescribed antibiotics in the past 24 hours relative to all patients admitted in the facility ward between 8 am and 12 pm on the day of the survey.
"A total of  patients (male-, female-) were reviewed."
"The average number of antibiotics prescribed per patient encounter was 1.85, adherence to standard treatment guidelines was 55% and the percentage of antibiotics prescribed by generic name was 59.6%."
H with support from partners conducted a prescription and medicine use audit in all public A total of  patients  were reviewed.
"The average number of antibiotics prescribed per patient encounter was 1.5, adherence to standard treatment guidelines was 50.01% and the percentage of antibiotics prescribed by generic name was 61.29%."
"Through the GLASSAMC, the classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and the volume of consumed antimicrobials are expressed as Defined Daily Dose (DDD)."
The antimicrobials associated with ATC/DDD listed in the ATC/DDD 2023 index were included in the analysis.
Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report The spike in 2021 was due to different data sources utilized for monitoring.
"Up until 2021, order data was considered instead of receipt data with the assumption that all that was ordered was 3.5.3.4."
"Tele-mentoring for Antimicrobial Stewardship The Tele-mentoring program for AMS was launched in  to support the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship through functionalizing the AMS structures, and high-impact interventions for quality improvement."
"To date, 15 sessions (detailed in was conducted in 6 facilities."
"A total of  participants composed of various cadres including Specialists, Medical Doctors, Pharmacists, Laboratory Technicians and Technologists, Counselors, As a result, 60% (n=33) of the participants have initiated new practices at their workplaces, and 85% (n=20) have observed improvement in patient management or patient outcomes as a result of implementation."
This is attributed to good leadership and governance as well as collaboration include the lack of internet connectivity to attend sessions and lack of resources to implement 3.5.4.
Pharmacovigilance There has been a 21% increase in Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reports received in the FY 2023/24 reporting period compared to those received in FY 2022/23.
"Whereas the percentage increase in reports is less than the 69% increase from the previous reporting year, ADR reporting continues a steady upward trend as pharmacovigilance efforts are extended to various health programs in the country."
"The majority of the reports were submitted from the HIV & TB health programme, where targeted sensitization campaigns have been conducted to encourage health workers to report even what is considered normal or expected side effects"
Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report Adverse Effects Following Immunization (AEFI) reports have steadily declined since the completion of the COVID-19 vaccination mass campaigns.
Traditional and Complementary Medicines There was a slight increase in the number of traditional and complementary medicines (TCM) notified by NDA from 326 products in FY 2020/21 to 422 in FY 2023/24.
"The NDA Herbal Unit has undertaken several initiatives to strengthen the regulation of herbal medicines by enhancing local capacity building, engaging with relevant national bodies, and fostering collaboration in herbal regulation."
"These efforts have been complemented by regional training sessions, stakeholder sensitization, and enforcement activities."
"Regional Trainings and Stakeholder Engagement The unit has conducted sensitization sessions for herbalists and bodies at various locations, including: JK Mugonza Herberlist  in Kyotera ;CBS PEWOSA Bulange ;Buwama Herbalists Association"
"Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report In addition, operations have been conducted to curb illegal advertising of herbal products and the unauthorized sale of herbal medicines on public transport, with enforcement efforts carried out at 3.6.2. International Collaboration To align with international standards, the NDA Herbal Unit participated in the 15th Meeting of the International Regulatory Cooperation on Herbal Medicines (IRCH), held virtually from -19, 2024."
"These activities reflect NDAs ongoing commitment to strengthening the regulatory framework for herbal medicines, ensuring compliance, and improving the quality and safety of herbal products Local manufacture of Health Commodities To enhance the local manufacture, the percentage of locally manufactured products registered with NDA is monitored."
"Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report Despite various incentives provided to manufacturers, such as training, exemption from fees for importing raw materials, reducing fees for registration and variations, the percentage of locally manufactured products registered with the NDA has remained low over the years."
"Local manufacturers continue to pose challenges, particularly the high cost of production, which is hindering the growth of local manufacturing."
There is a pressing need for more dialogue between the government and local manufacturers to find more effective and supportive solutions.
"While there was a surge in smallscale manufacturing firms producing sanitizers and masks during the Covid-19 pandemic which led to a rise in the proportion of medical devices, this has since declined."
The contribution by the locally manufactured pharmaceuticals has not registered any significant change for the past in FY22/23 has supported the local industry to reclaim the 50% market share in FY 2023/24.
"Local Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Lines Licensed As one of the pre-requisites for licensure, a firm should have at least one manufacturing line fully inspected and approved by the NDA, multiple manufacturing lines are an indicator of the level of specialization of the products manufactured (i.e."
"In the FY 2023/24, 19.6% (UGX 640.86 billion of UGX .9 billion) of the GOU health sector budget was allocated to health commodities, falling short of the target."
Public Sector Commodity Financing There was a 15.9% increase in the budget for EMHS at NMS from UGX 464 billion in FY 2022/23 to UGX 538 billion in FY 2023/24 as highlighted in program commodities.
"Local Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Firms Licensed There was a surge in small-scale manufacturing firms producing sanitizers and masks during the Covid-19 pandemic, but this has since declined due to reduced market for the two items hence the need for diversification in products manufactured."
There was a net increase of 4 licensed firms which communicates optimism in the growth of the local pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.
This initiative started in FY19/20 and it has been pivotal in increasing the availability and access to EMHS in the PNFP sector hence improving the quality of healthcare delivery.
"A total of UGX  (Thirteen billion, six hundred seventeen million, fifty-five thousand, nine hundred fifty-three shillings) was released from Mo."
"Budgeting for Health Supply Chain Activities Funding allocated to Health Supply Chain (HSC) activities by District Local Governments (districts and cities) has shown a progressive increase, as illustrated in grown significantly from UGX 298 million in FY 2022/23 to UGX 765 million in FY 2023/24, reflecting a steady move towards sustainability and local ownership of HSC interventions."
"However, this increment translates to an allocation of UGX 5.2 million ($) per district/City per FY which is still suboptimal and requires further enhancements."
The standardized nomenclature and product codes which are the unique product identifiers have been uploaded into the National Health Product Registry (NHPR).
"The NHPR has been developed using the open-source product catalogue management tool (PCMT), this tool includes provisions for Global Standards (GS1) codes, facilitating track and trace capabilities in line with global standards."
"Additionally, back-end application program interfaces (API) have been developed to enable interoperability between various systems and the national health product registry."
"Online Health Facility Stock Status Report Dashboard The Online Health Facility Stock Status Report (OFSSR) is directly integrated with the DHIS2 system, automatically fetching updated monthly stock data on the 41 tracer items reported in the HMIS 105 section 6 by over  public and private-not-for-profit health facilities."
The dashboard was rolled out to the users starting .
"As of , 2024, the cumulative access to the dashboard was  hits, a shift from 14 hits in  when the dashboard was deployed."
A total of 260 e. LMIS support supervision visits were conducted at health facilities.
This improvement was driven by intensified follow-up efforts from both national and sub-national stakeholders.
The IMTF meetings are hosted and chaired by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and co-chaired by the
"Coordinated by the OPM, the IMTF comprises relevant ministries, During the reporting period, four  meetings were held."
Other topics discussed included MDAs performance reporting of the planned HSC activities and scaling up and utilization of integrated electronic medical records in national and regional referral resolutions have been implemented.
A total of 16 meetings were held with discussions focused on issues affecting the availability of commodities including the NMSs nonadherence to the delivery schedule and strategies to catch up to minimize treatment interruptions.
"This innovation was rolled out and implemented in 10 sites (9 health facilities, 1-DHOs) in Yumbe District from ."
"Between  and , the supply chain data synchronization rate from the nine health facilities was 82% above the national average of 42%."
"Using the S+ console dashboard, 100% average System uptime was observed for all 9 facilities between ."
The results are currently being presented to the various technical working groups to obtain approval to apply the innovation to the wider scope of health facilities.
"Subsequently, by , 44/146 districts(30%) had registered measles outbreaks Interventions related to; 1) planning, coordination and financing, 2) vaccine, cold chain and logistics, 3) Training of SIA for quality, 5) Monitoring and supervision and 6) Advocacy, social mobilization and communication were supported At national level, the big catchup targeted to reach 95% of the  zero-dose children, however, we DPT3 was given to  out of the  targeted children thereby giving a coverage of 70%."
"This Big catch up was designed to reach children who have missed routine vaccinations, often due to disruptions in healthcare services, geographic barriers, or other challenges including those were affected by the COVID Pandemic restrictions."
"Big Catch-up vaccination refers to the action of vaccinating an individual who, for whatever reason, is missing or has not received doses of vaccines for which they are eligible, as per the national immunization schedule."
"Communities continued to face a range of local barriers to access, including social, financial and geographic factors, along with influences from proliferating vaccine misinformation Big catch up targeted Reaching children who missed vaccination during the period , which was partly due to COVID pandemic, and provide all missing vaccinations more so New vaccines namely Hep."
"B birth dose, IPV2, Yellow fever, Rotavirus3 and MR2 that were performing sub optimally."
The NPHC 2024 results indicate that the younger population constitutes a high percentage of both males and females and the age has relatively followed a declining trend.
The population growth is 2.9%.
"Wakiso district was the most populated with over 3.4 million people followed by Kampala with over 1.9 million people whereas Moroto and Kalangala districts were the least populated with  and The Big Catch-Up is a global initiative launched in  to close immunization gaps caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, restore global immunization levels, and strengthen immunization systems so that catch-up activities become an integral part of immunization programs."
"Decades of progress in immunization were reversed during the pandemic when, in 2021, coverage dropped to levels not seen since 2005, resulting in an alarming number of zero-dose children globally."
"The Big catch up was integrated with administration of praziquantel, child survival interventions such as deworming and vitamin A supplementation A catch-up vaccination schedule was designed in line with the national immunization schedule, that adhere to upper or lower age requirements as determined by the national immunization policy."
"Even If along time has passed between doses, theres no need to start the sries from the beginig."
"There is no Upper age limit for Vaccines (except rotavirus < 2years and Hepatitis BBD < 7 days Hep: As soon as possible after ideally within 24 hours and up to 7 days BCG: As soon as possible after birth Hep BBD: Not after 7 days At 6 weeks (or as soon as possible RV1: Not after 2 years of age At 10 weeks (or as soon as possible thereafter), and aleast 4 weeks At 14 weeks (or as soon as possible thereafter), and aleast 4 weeks At 9 months (or as soon as possible At 18 months (or as soon as possible thereafter), and aleast 4 weeks since previous dose Not before 4 weeks has passed RV3: Not after 2 years of age Not before 4 weeks has passed since the RV2: Not after 2 years of age Not before 4 weeks has passed Not before 9 months of age (ecept Its better to Vaccinate late than never!"
A big catch-up immunization package was a comprehensive set of services that are designed to support integrated health services to individuals across various age groups.
A child was considered zero dose if they reported never having received any vaccine since birth as of .
"According to the National Population Housing Census (NPHS) 2024,  zero dose children under 1 year were identified through house to house count and  children aged 1-4 years had never been vaccinated."
"The under zero dose children identified was our target for DPT1 and 1-4 years unvaccinated children became To derive the DPT3 target, the number of zero dose children was added to the children who dropped in the previous year giving us a target for DPT3 as To derive the target for MR2, the number of children not reached with MR2 since introduction of  MR2 in 2022 were our Big catch up target for MR2."
Therefore the target for MR2 was .
However we had districts that were responding to Measles outbreaks in the Big Catch up month and they did non selective vaccination.
The target for outbreak districts was 15.9% of the population to get estimated proportion of 9 All missed routine antigens incl.
"Check for 1st Dose MR Deworming, Praziquantel administration in endemic 78 districts HPV (Look out for girls aged 11-14 years who may have missed their due doses Integration of child Health Services in schools"
The following proportions were used to set targets for the rest of the Big catch up service package.
Coordination meeting at National and districts with all expanded partners and stakeholders from within and beyond the health sector were conducted to contribute to promoting and delivering vaccination during Big Resource mobilisation and partner mapping Resource mobilization for Big catch up was done to ensure widespread immunisation coverage.
"The orientation was conducted in a cascaded manner beginning with central, district and sub county level."
Central level Orientation of supervisors Teams were selected from Mo.
"One national supervisor from each district/city, Regional Referral partners, were trained through a 1-day virtual meeting at the National level."
Supervisors were deployed to districts to support in these areas.
"District level orientation Orientation of stakeholders and harmonization of the microplans was conducted for 1 day, led by the DHO with support of the central supervisor."
The micro-planning process was used to determine the appropriate strategies that were employed and to identify strategic partners to support the Catch-Up Plan.
Sub-county level orientation training for health workers and mobilizers was conducted for one day.
A village model was used to reach all eligible populations within the allocated days.
The model involved the following; Mobile Vaccination teams were deployed both at selected community posts (villages and schools) as guided by the micro plans for the catch-up in addition to static vaccination at all health facilities (public and private).
"Teams were estimated based on the number of villages in the district to bring the services closer to the communities comprehensive microplans aided by a standard micro planning template with all health facilities, sub counties and district stakeholders taking into consideration district specific peculiarities."
A total of  teams were deployed during the big catchup exercise with each team composed of 1 health worker and 1 mobiliser.
Each vaccination team was assigned 2 villages to reach the target population within the stipulated period.
Teams were guided by the daily movement plans on where to place the vaccination posts for each day and shifted only when the targets were achieved to another post or home or community where there were missed children or missed communities as Teams worked with the education primary and kindergarten) within their catchment areas and planned to reach them during the catch up period.
The vaccination catchup in the communities was supervised by the district health teams and health facility incharges who provided onward support to the teams till the exercise ended.
Reaching the Hard to reach areas: Lady Health worker riding to the vaccination team for Under 5 years children were
"Vaccine Quantification: Vaccine quantification for the districts was done based on district stock balances, doses used and number of children un/under immunised as per the National routine immunization schedule."
Quantification for MR vaccines was done centrally for the non selective vaccination in the measles outbreak districts considering the target population of 9 months to 5 years children.
Supplies Allocation and Distribution: All orders for vaccines and related supplies were processed at NMS and distribution from National to district level was conducted by NMS using the available refrigerated trucks.
Distributions were conducted at least two weeks before start of implementation with a few exceptions where delays were experienced.
Districts were encouraged to adjust their implementation dates based on availability/receipt of vaccines and related supplies.
Distribution from District to Health Facility level was conducted by the districts at least two days before the start of implementation.
Districts were provided with resources to support Cleaning and freezing of ice packs 10 days prior to the start of implementation.
"Fuel (diesel) was provided to support generator running, this is to enable un disrupted running of the deep freezers for ice pack freezing and ice lined refrigerators for vaccine storage, paraffin was provided for waste disposal in line with existing waste Cold Chain Maintenance: National Medical Stores (NMS) maintenance teams were deployed to supervise the BCU in districts with cold chain maintenance challenges such that they could support these identified districts to conduct preventive cold chain maintenance and develop contingency plans for  proper storage of vaccines and related supplies."
"Advocacy, Communication, and Social Mobilization Nationwide Social Mobilization Efforts A nationwide social mobilization campaign was conducted at both national and subnational levels, targeting all children under five, 10-year-old girls, and women of childbearing age."
These groups were guided to designated vaccination posts to receive appropriate immunization interventions.
"A comprehensive media campaign was launched to raise awareness and educate the public on Routine Immunization (RI), Measles and Rubella, Malaria Vaccine Introduction (MVI), and the Big Catch-Up (BCU) initiative."
"The campaign was designed to dispel misinformation, encourage vaccine uptake, and mobilize communities through strategic communication."
"To reinforce key immunization messages, strategic radio spots were developed and aired on 40 national and regional FM stations."
"These short, impactful messages were delivered in multiple local languages, effectively reaching various demographic groups, including parents, caregivers, and community influencers."
"Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) Materials asked questions about the Big Catch-Up campaign was developed and used as a key communication tool."
"It was shared electronically with all districts, cities, and municipalities involved in the campaign."
"To expand the campaigns digital reach, 20 influencers were engaged, posting 120 times daily across various social media platforms."
Community Mobilization and Training Sixty-seven District Health Educators (DHEs) were trained on the Big Catch-Up Campaign to enhance community involvement in immunization efforts.
Mobilisation vans were used to mobilise during BCU
"Media Practitioner Orientation In Jinja City, an orientation session was conducted for media practitioners, including presenters, DJs, editors, and journalists."
Cultural Leader Engagement in Busoga Kingdom Cultural leaders in the Busoga Kingdom were oriented in Jinja City as part of efforts to enhance communitydriven support for immunization.
"Faith Leader Engagement in Busoga Kingdom Similarly, faith leaders in the Busoga Kingdom were engaged in Jinja City to support RI, MVI, and BCU efforts."
"Given the trust communities place in religious leaders, their involvement was critical in dispelling vaccine hesitancy and encouraging positive health-seeking behaviors."
National-Level Inter-Ministerial Engagement One  high-level inter-ministerial engagement was conducted between the of Education and Sports to strengthen immunization programs in schools and communities.
"Media Breakfast Engagement As part of the campaigns conclusion, one media breakfast engagement supported by PATH was held to consolidate and wrap up the Big Catch-Up initiative."
"The M&Estrategy for the BCU was categorised into two House  to House (H2H) registration of all <5-year childrens data: House-to-house registration was done prior big catch-up to identify and list all eligible individuals, particularly children, in a specific area who are due for vaccination."
Children registered facilitated the development of The house to House registration forms were developed and designed targeting all under 5 year children including their vaccination status.
The data from House to House registration was used in the mobilisation and tracking of un/under immunised children.
The data set summarised  from house to house registration was secured in the MOH ODK database for future use especially defaulter tracking and deployment Readiness assessment: Three sets of readiness assessments at both national and sub national levels were done to  assess the level of preparedness across all immunisation core components (pillars) The readiness assessment was conducted through virtual and physical engagements.
"The assessment was done to provide actionable insights into infrastructure, human resources, supply chain systems, healthcare worker capacity, and community engagement mechanisms."
"The standard supplementary immunization activity (SIA) readiness assessment tool was shared with districts to keep updating the status of the key areas of; 1) planning, coordination and financing, 2) vaccine, cold chain and logistics, 3) Training of SIA for quality, 3) Monitoring and supervision and 4) Advocacy, social mobilization and communication."
"The Data Management flow chart for Measles outbreak responce districts that did non selective vaccination, special Measles vaccination cards were used To support real time monitoring, daily reporting tools were designed to support reporting of tracer antigens ie BCG, DPT1,DPT3,MR1,MR2,HPV1 and TD2+."
The daily reports were reported to EPIVAC (DHIS2 Instance).
"Monthly reporting: At the end of the month, all the outputs from big catch up was aggregated into monthly report (HMIS 105)."
The monthly data (BCU data) was reported to DHIS2 system.
District led readiness assessments were conducted 1 month to the implementation of the big catch up.
"Using a contextually pre-designed tool shared with districts, a series of virtual meetings were conducted with the districts to ascertain district preparedness basing on the completeness of the tool."
"A district was only allowed to start implementation once it was 80% and above ready During Implementation Recording Routine data tools (HMIS) including Child Health Card, HPV/TD card, Child Health Register."
HPV/TD register and Tally sheets were used during Big catchup for both zero dose and under immunised children both at static or outreach.
Below is the guidance used to record children during big catch up
"At the end of the month of implementation, data was entered into DHIS2 by the 15th day of ."
"Districts with outliers, inconsistencies and incompleteness were identified and followed up In order to further improve the quality of the BCU information for decision making, data triangulation was conducted to improve the quality of the analytics from the BCU."
"The information generated from the daily data reported through the EPIVAC was shared at the national, regional  and district stakeholders including the implementing partners."
Daily virtual meetings were conducted to disseminate the information for corrective action Performance review meetings A national stakeholder meeting was conducted to assess the performance of the BCU against the set targets.
"The meeting involved MOH team, District Health Team (DHO, ADHO-MCH & Biostat) The EPI dashboard was  designed to visualise and promote data use for evidence based decision making."
"The District Health Teams(DHO, ADHO-MCH & Biostat) were trained on how to navigate the DHIS2 dashboard to promote data use for immunisation"
"The highest DPT1 coverage was reported in Bugisu, Kampala and Teso regions."
Low coverage (less than 50%) was registered in 8 districts spread across different regions.
"At national level, the big catchup targeted to reach 95% of the  zero-dose children, however, we DPT3 was given to  out of the  targeted children thereby giving a coverage of 70%."
"Number of children reached by age Out of the  zero dose children reached,  children were above one year (1-4 years)."
"Out of the children reached with DPT3,  were in the age blacket of 1-4 years."
"Out of  children reached with MR1,  were in the age range of 1-4 years."
"And all the children reached for MR2 were in the range of 1-4 years () Attribution to Reaching zero dose children (1-4 years) during BCU During the Big catch up month, We reaching to more zero dose children (1-4 years) in an outreach mode and over and above the average numbers the program is able to reach with routine immunisation as illustrated DPT1-(<1-4 Yrs, Outreach)"
"Attribution to Reaching zero dose children (<1 years) during BCU During the Big catch up month , the program reached to more children under one through outreach efforts above and beyond the typical numbers of children who are vaccinated through routine immunization services as illustrated in the graph below Reaching the under-immunized (MR2) Most of the districts did perform below 50% MR2 coverage from the target (2 cohort target)."
"At national level, 50% of the targeted children were reached during Big catchup"
"Categorisation after Big catch up To assess effective program performance, EPI categorisation was done."
Notably the program was able to push more districts to category one and lessen districts in category 4 in the quarter Big catch up was EPI Categorisation after Big catch up
"Whereas increasingly more components are suggested to be added, the teams find it hard especially at outreaches."
"Vaccination outreaches were significantly affected by natural barriers particularly Hard to Reach areas, which affected both accessibility to service delivery."
"Inadequate Data Collection Tools: A widespread shortage of data collection tools was observed across districts, primarily due to many teams going out."
Delayed Implementation of the House-to-House Registration: The house-to-house registration exercise was designed to provide essential statistics for planning and implementing immunization activities.
"However, inconsistencies in execution were observed across districts with some delayed implementation,."
"As a result, decision-making processes were based on incomplete or outdated information, potentially leading to inefficiencies in service Data quality challenges: Some districts were reporting outliers attributed to data entry errors."
"Additionally, there were challenges of few or no recordings in the child health register which will affect defaulter Good Practices and Lessons Learnt (by pillar)"
"Regional Emergency Operation Centre are critical in supporting and coordinating vaccination activities Adequate budgeting and early mobilization of resources, including early disbursement of funds supports early planning and preparation Involvement of all key stakeholders right from planning to implantation is essential for a successful campaign."
Good governance and leadership at district level is critical for efficient implementation of the activities.
"Integration of Health Services: Combining immunization with other health services, such as deworming, malnutrition screening, and Vitamin A supplementation, maximizes impact and improves Timely micro plans by districts shared with the EPI program was key to providing reliable information on the target population and administrative units for funding."
The vaccination catch-up schedule provided was useful and supported the BCU implementation thereby enabling the reaching out of missed opportunities under immunised and zero doses.
"Timely availability of funds at district level motivates the district teams Mapping ERGS helps to focus immunization efforts where they are most needed, ensuring that no one is left behind."
"Cold Chain Investments: Expanding and maintaining cold chain infrastructure, especially in rural areas, is crucial for ensuring vaccine quality and preventing wastage."
"Availability and use  of waste management guidelines improved handling of waste generated during BCU Ongoing sensitization and education campaigns, using trusted community voices, can significantly reduce misinformation and improve vaccine acceptance."
"Active involvement of community leaders, cultural institutions, and grassroots organizations is critical for building trust, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and mobilizing households to participate in Monitoring and Evaluation House to house registration provides actual data of the target population for the vaccinating teams if well conducted and must be done two  to 3 weeks prior to the implementation."
"Real-time data collection tools and electronic reporting systems are vital for monitoring progress, identifying coverage gaps, and ensuring Immunisation Registry(EIR)  improves data quality and defaulter House to House  registration provided guidance to vaccinators where the pockets/hot spots of unimmunised children were."
"This Big catch up was designed to reach children who have missed routine vaccinations, often due to disruptions in healthcare services, geographic barriers, or other challenges including those were affected by the COVID Pandemic restrictions."
"Special appreciation goes to the guidance to ensure that the objectives of the Digital Health Architecture, Standards and Knowledge products (DH-ASK) are aligned to the priorities of the NDP III, Mo."
"H Strategic Plan 2020/212024/25, and the Health Information and Digital Health Strategic Plan Special gratitude is also extended to the Makerere Group for leading and collaborating in the research and development of the DH-ASK products."
"Whereas standardisation has been considered a remedy to digital health challenges in many countries; conversely, the digital health standardisation ground is troubled with numerous challenges, including a huge number of available standards, that compete, overlap and sometimes contradict one another; worse still, many of the available standards do not have implementation guidelines, which makes their implementation quite a difficult task."
"Standardisation has been considered as a remedy to digital health challenges in many countries (Adebesin et al., 2013; Adebesin & Kotz, 2017; WHO & ITU, 2012)."
"Conversely, the digital health standardisation ground is troubled with numerous challenges, including a huge number of available standards, that compete, overlap and sometimes contradict one another (Alunyu & Nabukenya, 2018; Hammond, 2017; WHO & ITU, 2012); worse still, many of the available standards do not have implementation guidelines, which makes their implementation quite a difficult task (Alunyu & Nabukenya, 2018; Mo."
"This has greatly affected ease-of-use for such health data to inform patient care, the digital health interventions that have been successful in one healthcare program, are most times not integrate-able with others nor adopted by other similar programs within and across the same health system (i.e., these interventions may be useful in a specific health program)."
"Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a description of an enterprise from an integrated business and IT perspective intended to bridge the communication gap between business and IT stakeholders and improve business and IT alignment (Kotusev, 2019; van de Wetering et al., 2021)."
The DHEAF constitutes of seven building blocks/components that have to support each other to realise a standardised Digital Health environment where all stakeholders can seamlessly share health information.
"These building blocks/components are intended to reduce duplication, redundancies, and complexity as well as to promote shared Digital Health solutions while emphasizing the security and privacy of health data."
All Digital Health systems shall be required to conform to the standards before they are allowed to integrate with other health systems.
The Integration Platform shall provide a single logical gateway into the core of the National Health Information System and standard-based channels for synchronous and asynchronous messaging between local Health Information Systems and the National Health Information System.
"The detailed contents of these shall be driven by the information architecture and the detailed design of core applications and core services, the definition of which will continue to evolve and mature as the new Knowledge & Information capabilities are implemented."
"H shall host all Digital Health applications and registries, endpoint devices, servers, and other storage devices as may be necessary."
Principles are general rules and guidelines intended to be enduring and seldom amended that inform and support how an organisation fulfils its mission .
Principles may be established within different domains and at different levels of an enterprise.
H Information Management Principles are structured according to The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) recommendations.
"Each principle has a Name that highlights the essence of the principle, a Statement that unambiguously communicates the fundamental rule, a rationale that gives the business benefit of adhering to the principle, and implications that outline the critical tasks, resources, and potential costs associated with following the principle."
"These principles are divided into two, namely; enterprise principles and architecture principles."
H Enterprise Principles Enterprise principles are general rules that provide a basis for decision-making throughout an enterprise and dictate how the organisation intends to fulfil its mission .
Such principles are commonly used to harmonise decision-making at the strategic level and are a crucial element of the governance strategy.
"The four enterprise principles presented in principle has a code that reflects the category (i.e., Health Sector Enterprise (HSE) and the principle number (i.e., P1)."
"A single enterprise with shared strategic objectives, joint governance, integrated management processes, and consistent policies improves the implementation of enterprise-wide strategies and the coordination of the delivery of health services to citizens Optimise resource allocations to achieve common goals across the entire health sector Ensure availability and access to health information for evidence-based decision-making across Digital Health architectural designs should integrate services for efficiency while keeping the autonomy of operations of the different units of the health sector Improve the safety and quality of healthcare for citizens Decisions about Digital Health must aim to improve the safety and quality of healthcare Providing safe, high-quality, and effective healthcare is a national priority."
Digital Health investment decisions should support this priority and thus minimise healthcare risks associated with inaccurate and inadequate healthcare information and processes.
"Apply applicable Institute of Medicine (IOM) quality principles of care to all decisions about Digital Health investments; that is, healthcare should be safe, effective, patient-centred, timely, Decisions about Digital Health investments should be driven by the need for safe, high-quality, effective healthcare rather than by technological or other external concerns Improve the efficiency of healthcare services Decisions about Digital Health investments should aim to improve the efficiency of healthcare service The provision of efficient healthcare is a national priority."
Digital Health investment decisions should support this priority and thus improve the healthcare delivery processes.
"Therefore, all citizens' health information should be protected against unauthorised access and intentional and accidental Protection of clients confidential health information will increase public trust in Digital Health and improve their utilization to deliver healthcare services The business context should define security and privacy requirements to be integrated into the entire Digital Health ecosystem Digital Health systems should embed national policies to minimise improper data use and Apply security and privacy information management policies and monitor compliance Information security controls should be clearly defined to balance costs and mitigate risks"
H Digital Health Architecture Principles Architecture principles are a set of principles that relate to architectural work.
They are not only expected to act as drivers for defining functional requirements for the architecture but will also be used as a guide when assessing Digital Health innovations.
"Each principle has a code, statement, rationale, and implication."
"Therefore, an inclusive and participatory development approach is required to address the collective"
One or more application services can support a business service.
Identify standard services that the other systems can re-use Business services identify information artefacts associated with service provision and use.
"Therefore, information models must be related to business services to determine the benefit to Assess the Total Cost of Ownership of Digital Health solutions The deployment of a new Digital Health capability should be based on an assessment of its business and social value as well as the implementation and operational costs New Digital Health capabilities are expected to support better healthcare; however, this would involve both technology and organisational change costs."
"Therefore, the operational cost of a solution must be identified and contained to ensure that the ongoing operation of the solution is feasible and viable."
"When making decisions to create a new Digital Health capability, stakeholders must consider the total cost of developing and maintaining the Digital Health solution Digital Health solutions should be acquired or developed, deployed, replaced and decommissioned at the least cost while ensuring fitness for purpose of an overall system Operational procedures and their likely cost must be identified early in selecting and developing a Digital Health solution"
Periodic reviews of the Digital Health solutions should be carried out to assure healthcare continuity.
"Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability should be addressed at the design time."
All Digital Health solutions that are critical in healthcare delivery must be assessed to determine what level of continuity is required and the necessary recovery plan.
Health organisations shall not be allowed to develop Digital Health solutions that are similar/duplicative to health sector-wide solutions.
"Comply with Laws, Policies, and Regulations Digital Health solutions and infrastructure should comply with applicable legislation and policies in all jurisdictions and organisations within which they operate Digital Health systems should comply with all applicable legislation, regulation, and standards."
Compliance is key to maintaining stakeholder trust (Quality assurance) in the services that Digital Health solutions provide.
"Define applicable legislative and policy requirements for all Digital Health solutions and infrastructure; otherwise, there is a risk of non-compliance."
"These requirements should be kept up to date to reflect changes in legislation and policy Digital Health developers and implementers must be compliant with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the collection, retention, management and dissemination of health"
"The National Information Policy outlines the minimum security controls that all public and private organisations must meet Rather than prescribing implementation mechanisms, policy requirements should be expressed in terms of obligations, permissions, prohibitions, outcomes, and performance requirements Manage Health Data as an Asset Health data must be managed so that its source and the times and places it is created, changed, updated, accessed, and ultimately disposed of are captured and retained."
"Health data is the foundation of decision-making within healthcare, so it must be carefully managed to ensure that we know where it is, rely upon its accuracy, and obtain it when and where we need it."
Health data components should always identify the time and place of information creation and change.
Versioning and metadata are one way of capturing this.
Services providing sharing or access to information may keep only the most recent or most accurate version but must acknowledge the existence of preceding versions.
Part of the role of the data steward is to ensure data quality.
Procedures must be developed and used to prevent and correct errors in Digital Health Steps to ensure the quality of data held by the Digital Health solutions should be implemented.
This is particularly important for sporadically connected systems and long-running transactions or processes.
"The process for establishing consistency of information should be explicitly defined for service Atomic transaction mechanisms may be used across services, but an alternate mechanism should always be provided to achieve consistency through discrete steps when information crosses organisational boundaries."
Transactional messaging is a valuable and robust mechanism that can support consistency processes but is not generally sufficient; a consistency process definition is still required.
Users of Digital Health should have access to the necessary shared data required to perform their respective business functions.
"In addition, shared data should be centrally controlled and managed."
"Electronically shared data will increase efficiency as Health organisations can use it, without rekeying, to create new entities."
"Users will rely on official sources of more accurate and timely managed data, thereby improving A common set of standards, policies, and procedures that users should adhere to should be developed to enable data sharing among Health organisations."
"Standard data models, data elements, and other metadata that define the shared environment should be developed and stored in a repository for easy access."
All users will have to rely on electronic data made available for sharing to execute their respective tasks.
This will ensure that only the most accurate and timely data is relied upon for Ensure Data Ownership and Responsibility Health organisations must own each data entity held by Digital Health systems.
Every Health organisation should be responsible for the integrity and security of its data.
"Therefore, each data entity held by Digital Health Systems must have an owner."
"Primary Data Source: All health data should have an authoritative, official, primary data source, which should be the location for all create, update and delete actions but this should be in line with data management guidelines of the health sector."
The lack of well-defined data ownership may lead to confusion about who can change the data held by the Digital Health systems.
"Otherwise, inconsistent, erroneous, and out-of-date data may result."
Data integrity is at its highest level when data changes are centrally done.
"Use Common Terminologies and Data Definitions There should be a standard, common and consistent definition of all data held by the Digital Health systems, which should be understandable and available to all users."
Data held by the Digital Health systems should be defined to ensure seamless interoperability.
Electronic data to be exchanged across the health sector and should have a standard definition with an agreed format and meaning of the data items.
"H shall coordinate all the data standardisation initiatives Promote the development of modular and component-based Digital Health solutions Digital Health solutions should be modular and component-based, aligned to business They should also conform to established open standards with well-defined roles & Components should be independent of the physical topology of the system and scalable."
Internet-based web standards and technology should be preferred for all solutions.
Ensure ease of use of solution Digital Health solutions should be easy to use.
Developers of Digital Health solutions must ensure that the underlying technology is transparent to users.
"This will allow users to concentrate on the The more a user has to understand the underlying technology, the less productive that user is."
Ease of use is a positive incentive for the use of a Digital Health system.
Digital Health applications shall be required to have a common look and feel.
"Guidelines for user interfaces should not be constrained by narrow assumptions about user location, language, systems training, or physical capability."
The Digital Health solutions should define and communicate the right of access and use.
Ensure technology independence of solutions Digital Health solutions should be independent of specific technology choices.
They should be able to operate on a variety of technology platforms.
Developers should adopt standards that support portability while developing Digital Health Subsystem interfaces should be developed to enable existing systems to interoperate with the new Digital Health system.
"Developers are encouraged to use programming software, which gives a high degree of priority to platform independence."
Embrace Requirements-Based Change Changes to Digital Health technology infrastructure should be made in response to the business needs of the health organisation.
"A technology change may provide an opportunity to improve the business process and, hence, change business needs."
The need for financial and technical assistance should be communicated by the business need Change management processes conforming to this principle should be developed and Control Technical Diversity Technological diversity should be controlled to minimise the non-trivial cost of maintaining expertise and connectivity between multiple processing environments.
"There is a real, non-trivial cost of infrastructure required to support alternative technologies for processing environments."
More infrastructure costs are incurred to keep multiple processor constructs interconnected and maintained.
"The technology blueprint of Digital Health shall only change when compatibility with current infrastructure improvement in operational efficiency or a required capability has been Re-use Digital Health components Components and services that are re-usable across the health sector are preferred over proprietary Duplicating capability is expensive and undermines interoperability by proliferating inconsistency Where infrastructure components are provided for re-use within Digital Health solutions, adoption, integration, and use of these components should be preferred to duplicating their functionality through bespoke development."
"The attributes of open standards such as platform independence, vendor neutrality, and ability to use across multiple implementations and the model for establishing open standards are what will allow for sustainable information exchange, interoperability, flexibility, data preservation & and greater freedom from technology and vendor lock-in Adoption of open standards will facilitate the storing of electronic health data using open data Choices should comply with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Code of Good Practice for the adoption and application of Standards."
"In particular, locally contextualised standards should be used where they exist."
The process for selecting new controls should consider both the degree of risk
"Achieving a standards-based Digital Health security environment will reduce operational costs, improve interoperability and improve supportability."
"Incorporate Security into Architecture Design Architectures should employ security measures to ensure integrity, confidentiality, and availability of IT services and applications."
Security should be designed into the architecture in a scalable and efficient manner.
The security architecture design should follow a modular design where the overall technology infrastructure is divided into functional layers/modules.
"In addition, it permits designers to evaluate and implement security on a module-by-module basis instead of attempting to complete the architecture Comprehensive published security standards for each layer/module of the IT architecture are a prerequisite for all security designs."
"Implement Least Privilege Standard Each Digital Health solution must incorporate a standard for the least privilege; thus, the baseline is the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform functions, actions, and access."
"The baseline for functions, actions, and access is the minimum required to complete the task, thus protecting users and the data they are using from inadvertent errors, exploitation, or attempts at deliberate misuse."
"Adhering to the principle of least privilege reduces the risk of attackers gaining access to critical systems or sensitive data by compromising a low-level user account, device, or Part of the solution design should ensure the principle of least privilege is incorporated into the solution to enhance the protection of data and functionality from faults and malicious Contains compromises to their area of origin, stopping them from spreading."
"The scope of audits can be reduced dramatically, thus ensuring the efficient use of scarce Users, clients, businesses, and the enterprise are better protected."
Implement appropriate Privacy and Security Safeguards Appropriate technical and organisational controls must be implemented to protect data and keep it The privacy and security of data are everyones responsibility.
"It is necessary to have policies and security safeguards implemented to protect health information, whether stored on paper or electronically."
"Access controls  Access to information should be on a need-to-know basis, with role-based Technical controls  Implement robust IT security controls such as password authentication, encryption, anti-malware software, patch management, firewalls, IDS, mobile device management, secure code reviews, etc."
Auditing  Digital Health systems should be audited at least twice a year.
"The cycle is enclosed by the architecture catalysts previously introduced so that all activities, deliverables, and guidelines are aligned to the constituents for the EA development to deliver a successful digital transformation initiative."
The DHEAF development process is based on the TOGAF Architecture Development Model (ADM) cycle and impersonates the architecture development structure of TOGAF.
"The TOGAF ADM is a generic and reliable method for architecture development, designed to deal with most systems and organisational requirements (The Open Group, 2018a)."
"It is, however, important to note that in navigating the architecture process, architects should leverage the reusable assets that are part of this framework."
"It is also necessary that the requirements are identified, stored, and input into all activities in the architecture process."
Health organisations should define all the non-functional requirements of the solution they would like to implement.
The architecture team should consider the domain-specific principles that derive the requirements and existing Digital Health Policies and standards when defining requirements.
"Specifically, it is concerned with determining and establishing the architecture capability needed by a health organisation and defining the principles that will constrain the digital transformation effort."
The primary goal of this phase is to create a highlevel aspirational vision of the business capabilities targeted by the health organisation.
"Therefore, critical activities of this phase should include; identifying key stakeholders and their concerns, evaluating business capabilities, defining the scope of work, and developing an Architecture Vision."
"The principal technique applied here is Business Capability Modelling (BCM), used with business process models."
All process models should be associated with enterprise-level information entities to reflect what business objects are accessed or ealized as they are executed.
"In this phase, the architects create both the Data and Application Architecture, which they may design either sequentially or concurrently."
"Data Architecture Phase is concerned with defining the data considerations that support the Business Architecture, including; data management (i.e., collection, processing, storage, and dissemination), migration, and governance."
"As part of the Data Architecture, the architecture team should consider developing the Application/Organisation, Role/Application, Application Interaction, and Application Function matrices."
"Likewise, existing technology components to be supported in the target environment may need to be re-defined to ensure fit-for-purpose and interoperability."
The architecture team is encouraged to take advantage of relevant Technology Architecture resources provided by the TOGAF Technical Reference Model (TRM).
"As part of this phase, the architecture team should review the target business objectives and capabilities of the health organisation, consolidate the gap analysis results and the interoperability requirements from the Business to Technology Architecture phase, and then organize groups of building blocks to address these capabilities."
The architecture team should also conduct readiness assessment exercises to evaluate the health organisations ability to absorb change.
"Finally, centering on the readiness assessment results, the architecture team should develop a series of Transition Architectures (delivery vehicles) to generate a high-level Implementation and Migration plan."
"Business value must be associated with the capabilities at this stage, and capability increments should be used to assign the business values."
"When estimating resource requirements, costs should be divided into capital (to create the capability) and operations and maintenance (to run and sustain the capability)."
"This should include integrating all project activities, dependencies, and the impact of change into a project Finalising the Architecture Vision and Architecture Definition Documents, in line with the agreed implementation approach."
The implementation team should review the migration planning outputs and produce recommendations for deployment.
"It should also identify building blocks for replacement, perform a gap analysis between the DH Architecture and solutions framework and produce a gap analysis report to guide implementation decisions."
"Additionally, the deployment team should be educated about the overall architecture deliverables and expectations from specific development and implementation projects."
The goal is to ensure that the architecture achieves its original target business value.
"In addition, the architecture team should put in place a change management process for the implemented architecture."
"The change management process, once established, will help to determine: Circumstances under which the implemented architecture, or parts of it, will be permitted to change and the process by which that will happen; The circumstances under which the architecture development process will be initiated again to develop a new architecture."
The architecture team should engage stakeholders and agree on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each transition architecture/delivery vehicle.
S) performances and usage Managing architecture risks and providing recommendations on how the risks can be mitigated.
"In performing this activity, the architecture team is encouraged to use the approved Risk Management Framework for the Mo."
"H. If this is not available, the architecture team may adopt the Risk management process part in the Digital Health Enterprise Architecture Governance Model."
"Providing analysis for architecture change management, including: Conducting architecture performance reviews; Assessing requests for change and reporting to ensure that the expected value realisation and Service-Level Agreement (SLA) expectations are met; Undertaking a gap analysis of the performance of the architecture;"
Ensuring that requests for change adhere to the Request for Change that is part of the Digital Health Enterprise Architecture Governance Model; Documenting recommendations on change requirements to meet performance Activating the architecture process to implement the required change.
"Statement of Architecture Work Architecture Definition Document Architecture Requirements Specification Request for Change due to business and technology changes Implementation and Migration Plan Changes to architecture vision and principles New Request for Architecture Work Evaluation of Digital Health interventions helps to generate data that can be used as a basis for assessing whether observed changes in behavior, processes or health outcomes can be attributed to the Digital Health interventions (Lau & Kuziemsky, 2016; WHO, 2016)."
"Evaluation is defined as a systematic and objective assessment of an intervention that aims to determine the fulfilment of objectives, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability ."
"Monitoring is the routine collection, review, and analysis of data intended to measure implementation progress for Digital Health initiatives, and results in adjustments in intervention activities necessary to maintain or improve the quality and consistency of the Digital Health deployment."
"The model indicates the key Digital Health evaluation questions that should be answered; the key domains of performance indicators, and the data sources where the data needed to measure the indicators can be collected at each stage of the results chain."
"The evaluation of impact focuses on establishing how improvements in service delivery impact health by capturing long-term outcomes, and impact on health that are attributed to the health intervention being supported Digital Health Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Model Also, to note is a feedback loop in monitoring of the programme inputs and activities, and DH outputs."
DHM & EF Evaluation Indicators and Operationalisation Tools The DHM&EF Evaluation indicators and operationalisation tools (Appendix C1) demonstrate how the DH interventions performance can be measured at each stage of the
"To note is that, this set of example indicators and operationalisation tools are general and non-exhaustive; henceforth requiring that priority indicators and their operationalisation tools for use to monitor and evaluate a specific DH intervention should be selected based on the relevance of the intervention and modified to reflect the specific objectives of the intervention."
DH Interventions Evaluation Guidelines The last component of the DHM&EF Evaluation framework provides a set of guidelines (strategies and course-of-actions) that are intended to guide/facilitate the users through a step-by-step process of planning and executing activities for monitoring and evaluation of DH interventions.
These should be followed with adaptation to the DH context.
Establish dedicated resources and effort to ensure an effective process and such considerations should be provided from the inception of the initiative.
"DH implementers should plan and budget for monitoring and evaluation of the interventions during planning and costing of their DH programmes, to ensure that appropriate resources are dedicated (WHO & ITU, 2012)."
"The reference model provides a graphical representation to aid the clarification of monitoring and evaluation scopes and identification of expected causal links between inputs and activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts for DH implementations, while the indicator domains and indicators provide a non-exhaustive list of some examples of indicators that can be measured under each stage of the results chain."
"Stakeholders should agree on the stage of maturity of the DH intervention and determine the appropriate monitoring or evaluation activities to avoid embarking on premature DH results (WHO, 2016)."
"Define stakeholder priorities and their projected impact of the DH intervention and outcomes required to cause the defined impact, and the respective impact and outcome measurable indicators while ensuring that the interests of all identified stakeholders are addressed."
Evaluation of a DH intervention can be limited to its process and early outcomes without the need to evaluate its long-term outcomes and impact if the DH is supporting a health intervention with known efficacy based on prior research.
The outputs should include immediate results of the DH intervention and should also capture usability measures that help quantify how users interact with the DH intervention.
Indicators for the availability of resources required to support monitoring and evaluation functions should also be considered while defining indicators for the DH inputs and activities.
"It necessitates research and analysis to determine baseline measures for each indicator, while internal analysis and input from the subject-matter experts and other health experts are necessary to determine target measures (WHO & ITU, 2012)."
"Considering that monitoring and evaluation tasks are conducted at different and various times and by various parties, their governance model must be defined to guide the available functions, roles, responsibilities, and required mechanisms to deliver them."
Prepare for and initiate the monitoring and evaluation process that should continue ongoing in parallel with the DH implementation (Mo.
"Depending on the timelines or reporting frequency set for each of the identified indicators, the indicators should be reviewed, and if necessary revised at the start of each next monitoring or evaluation cycle."
The review and revision ensure that data is collected on the most relevant indicators during the monitoring or
Analyze collected data and report on the actual situation versus target DH adoption and results as per defined indicators (see example reporting tool in may also include identification of causes of divergences in actual and target performance at each stage in the results chain for each timeframe of measuring results.
"Engage stakeholders to agree on corrective actions to address divergence between target and actual results, and provide for management of changes in the DH implementation scope, if required, to implement agreed corrective actions (Mo."
"For indicators that may be unrealistic or unachievable within the required timeframes, engage stakeholders to review and agree on re-fined indicators, targets and timeframes for consideration in the next round of results measurement."
Architecture Governance is the practice by which Enterprise Architecture and other architectures are managed and controlled at an enterprise-wide level .
"Each level has specific roles and responsibilities in the development, implementation and use of Digital Health."
Monitor and provide strategic direction for the Digital Health Enterprise
"Digital Health Technical Advisor (Proposed) The Digital Health Technical Advisor will serve as an expert who understands what it takes to develop, deliver and maintain high-quality Digital Health Enterprise Architecture."
"Additionally, the Digital Health Technical Advisor shall provide technical advice regarding Digital Health Enterprise Architecture implementation to the Division of Health Information Management."
"Health Information, Innovation and Research Technical Working Group (Exists) The Health Information, Innovation and Research (HIIRE) Technical Working Group (TWG) is a multi-sectoral body responsible for providing technical advice to Mo."
Ensure that the adoption of the discipline of architecture-based development is across Monitor and control the Architecture Contracts.
"In addition, it is responsible for reviewing and monitoring Digital Health strategy outcomes and developing strategic recommendations and priorities for consideration by the HIIRE TWG."
"Ensure that DH Enterprise Architecture programs/projects are carried out consistently and successfully in compliance with standards, procedures, and strategies."
The Program office will inspect Digital Health Enterprise Architecture artefacts/ deliverables and provide coaching to Digital Health projects teams requiring additional support.
They can work in conjunction with DH stakeholders to develop the standards.
As part of their mandate to oversee that the Digital Health Communities of Practice (Exists) The Digital Health Communities of Practice is a group of architects and other information technology and subject matter experts with shared interests and shared concerns and passion for Digital Health.
"Roles and Responsibilities: Influence the practice of EA by advising the Health Information, Innovation and Research (HIIRE) Technical Working Group in the development of Digital Health Digital Health Enterprise Architecture Governance Processes Architecture Governance processes are a set of activities that an organisation executes to support decision-making and accountability during the implementation of an architecture ."
"The Digital Health Enterprise Architecture governance processes are intended to help identify, manage, audit and disseminate all information related to architecture contracts and implementation management."
"In addition, these processes are designed to ensure the monitoring of all architecture artefacts and contracts, principles, and operational-level agreements generated by Digital Health initiatives."
H should adhere to the following: Mo.
H Top Management shall have the authority to issue architecture policies.
"Records should specify who made the change, why they made it, and when the change was made."
H should put a central place (repository) where DH Organisations can easily access all architecture policies.
Clear and well-organised architecture policies provide little benefit if the people who need them cannot access them.
H should ensure that all EA policies are accessible to the public through the Mo.
H should put a feedback mechanism for Digital Health stakeholders comments on the architecture policies.
H should regularly review all architecture policies.
The review dates should be agreed upon when the policy is first created.
A key element of effective policy management is an ongoing commitment to review and update all policies before they become outdated periodically.
Drafting or revision of architecture policies should follow a formal process.
Following a formal process results in policies that are consistent and reflect the needs of followed to develop or review architecture policies.
"Architecture Compliance Review An Architecture Compliance Review is a scrutiny of the compliance of a specific project against established architectural criteria, spirit, and business objectives (The Open Group, 2018a)."
Confirming the compliance of individual DH projects with the Digital Health Enterprise Architecture framework is an essential aspect of Architecture Governance.
Architecture compliance reviews should be held at appropriate project milestones.
The most appropriate times are when the architecture is taking shape but when there is still time to correct any errors or shortcomings in the architecture effort.
"The Division of Health Information (DHI) Management, which is the overall overseer of all Digital Health initiatives in the Mo."
"H, shall request the Digital Health Enterprise Architecture Program Office to undertake a compliance review for a Digital Health initiative that is under execution."
The Division of Health Information shall provide the Digital Health EA Program office with all pertinent architecture information required for the review.
"If the architecture of the Digital Health project is fully compliant, the DHI will allow the project to continue."
"If the architecture is partially compliant, the Digital Health project shall be required to submit a reworked architecture within one month."
"If the architecture is non-compliant, the DHI shall forward the review report to HIIRE TWG for further consideration."
"In this case, a risk is added to the appropriate risk register; an assessment shall be carried out to determine its likelihood and impact."
"If the likelihood and impact of the risk are high, HIIRE TWG may issue recommendations that may include suspension of work until the risks have been effectively mitigated."
"Request for Exception (Dispensation) There may be cases in which a Digital Health initiative or a subject area (design, operation, service level, or technology) does not comply with the DH Enterprise Architecture Framework."
These non-compliance cases may either be known at the initiation stage or are revealed through the Architecture Complains reviews.
"In cases where the non-compliant subject area, despite best efforts utilized, cannot comply with the Digital Health EA Framework and needs more time to comply, dispensation may be requested for the subject area (The Open Group, 2018a)."
"If the request is required, the health organisation will be allowed to submit a dispensation request to the Digital Health Program Office."
"The appropriate subject matter experts should assess each request, and the assessment shall include an evaluation of the health organisations ability to implement the Digital Health Enterprise Architecture Framework."
"After the assessment, the assessor shall provide a written recommendation to the relevant governing bodies for consideration."
"The recommendations should include any outstanding issues and risks, and conditions on granting the dispensation."
"The recommendations may include a deadline for removing the need for the exception, constraints on future projects, or similar terms."
"Step 2: Appeal (if necessary) request at Division of Health Information Management If the Digital Health EA Program Office does not grant the request and a particular Digital Health stakeholder is dissatisfied, the decision may be appealed to the DHIM."
The DHIM may request additional information to make its decision.
"Step 3: Re-appeal (if necessary) at HIIRE Technical Working Group If the DHIM does not grant the request, the Digital Health project may submit an appeal to the HIIRE Technical Working Group."
"Therefore, it is important that risks are classified, identified, and mitigated early enough so that they can be tracked through a formal risk management process ."
The goal is to define prevention and control mechanisms to address the risks attached to specific activities and valuable assets.
"Where such a process exists but is insufficient, it can be extended by best practices stipulated in ISO Risk Management Framework or The Open Group Enterprise Architecture Framework."
"Key steps to the risk management process should include classification, identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment."
"Continuous monitoring and review should also be carried out to audit the behavior of the whole environment allowing, for instance, the identification of changes in risks or the suitability of implemented risk treatment procedures and activities."
"Also, there should be continuous communication and consultation with key stakeholders."
"Architecture Repository Management The Architecture Repository is a software tool that stores the essential architectural inputs and outputs, including Architectures themselves, the elements of which they are composed, standards, , principles, and the Governance Register (The Open Group, 2018a)."
"H Enterprise Architecture; segment architecture, which provides more detailed operating models for different healthcare domains; and capability architecture, which shows in detail how a unit of capability is going to be realised."
"H. Reference Library  stores guidelines, templates, patterns, and other forms of reference material that can be leveraged to accelerate the creation of new architectures for health organisations within the Mo."
Architecture Requirements  stores all authorised architecture requirements which have been approved by the HIIRE Technical Working Group (Architecture Review Board).
Solutions Landscape  stores Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) supporting the Architecture Landscape which have been planned or deployed by the health organisation.
"The Digital Health Information Security Architecture (DHISA) intends to strengthen security regarding; Confidentiality (ensuring that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorised entities), Integrity (protecting the accuracy and completeness of information), and Availability of health data/information (being accessible and usable when an authorised entity demands access) (ISO/IEC 27000 standard) held by Digital Health The DHISA as presented in Architecture (SABSA) framework for enterprise security architecture and the Principles for Digital Development which outline best practices for digital health programming."
"Additionally, DHISA includes all security considerations related to governance, technology, and operations that are required to protect the information assets of Mo."
"H. Specifically, the components are intended to ensure security of health information held by Digital Health systems by providing accountability and assurance."
Security Drivers  these are elements (internal and external) that can act as a source of information security for an organisation.
DHISA highlights four key security drivers that Health organisations should focus on when identifying security requirements.
Business requirements and opportunities are the key sources of internal security requirements.
These have the service-level business requirements that must be met to effectively and efficiently provide services to clients.
External security requirements may be derived from threats and the need to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
Privacy and confidentiality are key examples of functional requirements driven by legal requirements.
"Security Requirements  these represent an information security functionality that ensures that the security properties of an Information system are being satisfied (Harris & Maymi, 2019)."
"Security requirements of Digital Health systems should be defined in terms of availability, integrity, and confidentiality."
Monitoring and Evaluation  this is the ongoing assessment of a Health organisation's compliance with DHISA and responding to changes that may impact any aspect of the security governance processes and policy framework.
"Education and awareness  these are programs that create awareness about current information risks and security practices so that DH users are empowered to protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and data."
"Security Governance  these are principles, policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures that allow the security goals to be set, expressed, and communicated throughout the different levels of a Health organisation."
"Security Technology  this is a set of conceptual diagrams and blueprints that document what the resulting security system will look like from various perspectives, including; conceptual, logical, and physical architectures."
Security Operations  these are security considerations for the day-to-day operations of the security services and supporting infrastructure.
"Incident management  the process for responding to security-related events that indicate a violation or imminent threat of a breach of security policy (i.e., the organisation is under attack or has suffered a loss)."
Security Governance  establishes a governance model that Health organisations can use to assure that their DH information security strategies are aligned with and support business goals of Mo.
"H and are consistent with applicable laws and regulations through adherence to policies and internal controls, and provide assignment of responsibility."
"Principles  are general rules and guidelines intended to be enduring and seldom amended that inform and support how an organisation sets about fulfilling its mission (Josey et al., 2018)."
Digital Health should always be aligned to established governance principles unless a governance body has granted an exception.
"Depending on the Health organisation, governing principles may be established at one or more levels."
"When adapting security principles to their needs, Health organisations should ensure that they are aligned with the high-level IT principles, which guide the use and deployment of all IT resources and assets across the enterprise."
The DHEAF provides a list of security principles that Health organisations can adopt for their environments.
"Policies  are governance tools used to enforce an organisations guiding principles (Harris & Maymi, 2019)."
"They define the authorizations and a program of actions adopted by an organisation to govern the use of technology in specific areas of management control and are established and maintained through standards, guidelines, and procedures in accordance with related legal and business principles."
Health organisations should define a set of policies for information security and have them approved by their respective management.
"The information security policies should contain statements concerning definition of information security, objectives and principles to guide all activities relating to information security; assignment of general and specific responsibilities for information security management to defined roles and, processes for handling deviations and exceptions."
"Additionally, security policies should be reviewed at planned intervals or if significant changes occur to ensure their continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness."
"Standards, Procedures and Guidelines  these are mandatory activities, actions, or rules."
"Policies should be implemented through; technical standards (mandatory directives that must be adhered to by all users), guidelines, and procedures (describe how to achieve the standard or guideline), which are distinguished as follows: Enforcement  the process of ensuring compliance with policy."
"For all Health Organisations, enforcement of information security should be accomplished through a combination of technical controls, process and procedure controls, and management controls."
Controls should be built into the implementation of technical standards and procedures.
Management controls should provide for discretionary invocation of enforcement processes (such as disciplinary actions) as a result of security events or incidents.
"Audit  an Information security audit is an organized, quantifiable technical assessment of how the organisations security policy is employed ."
Health organisations are encouraged to establish their own security audit frameworks and have them formally approved by relevant authorities.
The model is described at four levels of abstraction; a.
Conceptual Architecture  is a generic technical framework for policy-based security services.
"The conceptual architecture should clearly state the overlap between policy management and runtime security services management splitting it into identity management, access management, and configuration management services, which represent three roles of the tactical security."
Access management services  responsible for assigning and maintaining resource access privileges across the electronic computing environment and for terminating those privileges when they are no longer required.
"Access management services may encompass a variety of components such as access policy definition, account creation, and access control list (ACL) Configuration management services  responsible for consistently setting and maintaining the security configuration across the electronic computing environment."
Configuration management is where the e. Health security technology extends to include distributed components for all security services.
"Configuration of the various security services should include; boarder protection, threat detection, content control, auditing, cryptography, and even configuration management itself."
User administration may be delegated to an administrator at the affiliate enterprise site.
"Identity registration and vetting functions  provide the means for establishing digital identities for persons that might not go through the human resource system, such as contractors or consultants."
"Additional functions may be included to support special identity attributes, such as security clearances or citizenship, which may be provided by external organisations other than internal human resource system."
"This architecture environment should have multiple documents, including; Software component layering on servers and network topology diagrams, all network addresses of Domain Controllers in an environment, and documentation of the configuration settings for software components."
"Design and development guidance may range from overall process guidelines to specific guides, templates, and tools."
"These may include design patterns, code samples, reusable libraries, and testing tools."
All of these are aimed at effective utilization of information security architecture and effective integration into the environment.
This guidance can be applied to
Further guidance on how these can be addressed can be found in ISO 27002.
Hs DHISAF has a strong dependency on asset management.
"Common components include a repository of hardware and software assets (including the configuration and usage information), a capability to discover assets as they are added to the network, and reporting capabilities (ISO/IEC, 2018)."
"This information may be used for activities e.g., contract renewals, software license compliance audits, and cost reduction activities."
An inventory of these assets should be drawn up and maintained on a regular basis.
"This is accomplished by planning, coordinating, and implementing the Digital Health systems and best practices required to create and maintain secure access to resources and protect the integrity of the system and device configurations."
It is also responsible for management of authentication tokens and certificates); 2).
It is also responsible for ensuring that updates to the actual devices are reflected in the asset database).

"These errors are exacerbated by cognitive biases, limited access to laboratories, and socioeconomic barriers that delay care-seeking."
"Crucially, it empowers patients and communities through strategies to improve health literacy and advocacy (eg, second-opinion campaigns, feedback mechanisms)."
"The search was limited to English-language articles published between 2014 and 2024, with priority given to studies from sub-Saharan Africa."
Discrepancies were resolved through consensus with a third reviewer.
"Data were analyzed thematically using the Safer Dx framework,2 which examines structural factors (resources, systems), Donabedians structure-process-outcome model18 to evaluate health system performance."
"Factors That Influence Diagnostic Errors During To better understand the influences of diagnostic errors in a healthcare system, we applied the Safer Dx framework2 which is grounded in the Donabedian model18,19 to evaluate the structural, process, and outcome-related factors that affect diagnostic safety."
Many errors occur before laboratory tests in a phase where systemic failures are particularly evident.
"Healthcare safety teams are encouraged to focus not only on structural factors but also on process factors involved in the patient-provider encounter, including the history-taking, physical exams, ordering necessary tests or referrals, interpreting diagnostic tests, and tracking diagnostic information over time."
"The identification of intermediate outcomes, such as safe diagnosisensuring diagnoses are accurate and timely is essential, alongside accounting for patient and healthcare delivery outcomes."
"Nighttime admissions particularly increase the risk of misdiagnosis as care is typically focused on stabilizing patients rather than thorough investigation, compounded by Additional structural contributors to diagnostic errors encompass issues related to human resources, such as under staffing, inadequate training, and insufficient mentoring, which hinder diagnosticians in effectively managing various medical conditions, especially in resource-limited settings."
"Out-of-pocket payments, particularly in private-for-profit facilities, may lead to diagnostic malpractice, where financial incentives override the commitment to accurate diagnoses."
"Conversely, public health facilities may focus less on diagnostic precision due to accessibility challenges such as limitations in medical technology and equipment, access to laboratory, imaging, and radiological resources which hamper timely and precise diagnostic capabilities."
"Overall, a multifaceted approach that addresses cognitive errors, systemic flaws, human resource challenges, financial incentives, and technological deficiencies is crucial for reducing diagnostic errors in any healthcare setting."
"Adequate Laboratory and Imaging Services as a Means to Prevent Diagnostic Errors The second major theme focused on the importance of adequate laboratory and imaging services in preventing diagnostic High quality, timely laboratory tests and imaging are crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions."
"Access to accurate test results and appropriate imaging allows healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, reduce misdiagnoses, and improve patient outcomes."
"When laboratories are unable to perform necessary tests, patients are referred to higher-level or private facilities for those services."
It is also crucial to understand that errors can occur even with correctly performed tests.
"Ministries of Health should always advocate for better diagnostic stewardship, urging healthcare providers to assess pre-test probabilities."
"Overall, addressing these challenges is essential for improving laboratory services and ensuring better health outcomes."
"Patients were encouraged to advocate for their safety, playing a vital role in reducing diagnostic errors."
This requirement is crucial for ensuring ongoing skill enhancement and effectiveness in patient care.
"All in all, diagnostic errors are complex to understand, requiring detailed chart reviews by trained professionals or peer reviews by subsequent physicians."
"In collaboration with partners, there is a revised Patients Charter,32 outlining the rights and responsibilities of patients."
"Mechanisms for feedback and redress at health facilities are assessed through the Client Satisfaction Feedback Initiative.30 Healthcare workers have been empowered through capacity-building initiatives to educate both patients and colleagues about the Right to Health, as outlined in the Patients Charter."
Conflicts between patients and healthcare workers have been effectively addressed through targeted training and community dialogue.
These efforts have strengthened feedback mechanisms at health facilities by fostering communica tion through community meetings and supporting the Health Unit Management Committees (HUMCs).
"There are also ongoing campaigns focusing on promoting health-seeking behavior, emphasizing early diagnosis and improving the interaction time between healthcare providers and patients ( patient is an empowered patient, capable of making informed decisions about their care."
"Leveraging the Safer Dx framework,2 which underscores the complexity of diagnostic errors, a series of interventions were proposed at the national, health facility, and community levels to address sociotechnical gaps in diagnostic safety."
"Diagnostic errors should be seen as opportunities for learning, ultimately leading to enhancements in healthcare quality."
"For facilities already engaged in reporting adverse events, it is essential to integrate diagnostic error reporting into existing systems to create a holistic approach to patient safety."
Supportive Supervision and Healthcare System Reorientation Enhancing technical supportive supervision specifically targeting diagnostic safety is crucial.
"Health facility managers should focus on internal supportive supervision and optimize care, particularly during nights and weekends when staffing shortages impact quality."
"Health systems must adapt to changing demographics, including multimorbidity and emerging diseases,33 while healthcare services and health management information systems (HMIS) should support an aging population."
"Additionally, targeted interventions are needed to address mens health-seeking behaviors, as many experience delays or inaccuracies in diagnosis."
Digitization and EHR Implementation Fast-tracking the institutionalization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) integrated with decision support systems can further improve diagnostic accuracy.
Evidence from developed nations shows that EHRs have significantly reduced diagnostic errors.
"Additionally, enhancing utilization of technology, such as precision medicine and artificial intelligence (AI), can alleviate healthcare workers burdens and enhance care, particularly in rural areas with limited resources."
There has been increasing concern regarding unethical practices by some private intentionally misdiagnose or recommend unnecessary investigations for profit.
"Continuous Education and Team Communication Mandatory continuous professional development and medical education programs are essential for healthcare profes sionals, especially in emergency and outpatient implementing diagnostic protocols will further enhance accuracy."
"Cultivating a patient safety culture that prioritizes diagnostic accuracy, supported by tools like autopsies and as learning opportunities helps improve patient care and reduce future errors."
Teamwork and Communication Enhancement Maximizing teamwork and communication among healthcare teams is key to improving diagnostic outcomes.
"Online peer-to-peer consultations provide real-time second opinions, enhancing diagnostic safety and fostering trust."
"Future research should prioritize quantitative error tracking systems, expanded private sector inclusion, longitudinal studies, and pilot testing of proposed interventions like AI decision-support tools to strengthen evidence and validate findings in comparable LMIC settings, ultimately advancing diagnostic safety improvements."
"The lessons from WPSD 2024 are clear: accurate diagnosis is both a moral imperative and achievable target, one that demands commitment, innovation, and collective action."

"We gratefully acknowledge their financial and technical contributions, which have been instrumental in supporting events of special interest (AESIs) during the period"
"In particular, MOH extends its sincere thanks for the support provided during implementation of the Special thanks go to the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) that provided extensive logistical and technical support as the implementing partner from the inception of this project up to the end, and in particular Dr. Christine Kihembo who worked tirelessly to ensure the deadlines are met by the different persons."
This work would have been impossible without their support.
The goal was to reduce morbidity and mortality while ensuring the continuity of essential services.
"Given that the vaccines were authorized under emergency use listing, the country adverse events of special interest (AESI) and assess potential safety concerns following COVID-19 vaccination."
Using qualitative approaches data was collected through desk reviews and key informant interviews at the national level and all eight sentinel sites.
Systematic vaccine safety surveillance is indispensable in ensuring public trust of the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) and quality of vaccines.
"In addition, acknowledging that routine passive reporting systems might not be sufficient to allow the rapid assessment and appropriate public health response during COVID-19 vaccine introduction; active safety surveillance is recommended, Guillard-Maure Cet al., 2017."
The specific objective of the HBSSS was to assess the risk of pre-defined AESI following vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine by brand.
Participating RRHs were those with good vaccine management and accountability systems greater than 2 million people.
"Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), are pre-defined medically significant events with cause-effect potential with vaccine product(s) warranting ongoing, careful, pro-active post market evaluation that need to be carefully monitored and any potential association to vaccination confirmed by further investigation(Voss et al., 2023)."
"To monitor and evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in near real-time and maintain public confidence in the vaccination program, a subset of ten AESI drawn from a total of 27AESl was prioritized based on our capacity as a country and resources needs."
"All patients that presented with the pre-determined AESl were included in the evaluations regardless of vaccination status with a COVID-19 vaccine, so that the unvaccinated, age-matched cohort could provide background frequencies of the specified AESl."
"Retrospective surveillance for background frequencies of the AESI (before vaccine roll-out) was conducted for months (specifically April, 2020 to )."
The surveillance staff were supported to carry out examination of relevant medical records including DHIS2 for all participating facilities for background and baseline AESI assessment.
The surveillance team obtained number of pre-specified AESI conditions per health facility were recorded in the AESI Line List.
"For facilities with paperbased medical records, designated surveillance staff (e.g., surveillance officers or nurses/ physicians at the participating sites) were trained to abstract AESl through daily review of medical charts (e.g., admission pre-defined AESl."
"Additionally, medical charts for all patients eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on national recommendation were reviewed by surveillance staff; (children 12-17 years, adults above 18, those with co morbidities regardless of the age)."
"The time frame for the prospective surveillance was 6 months, but with provision of extension Between 2022 and 2024, US CDC/GIST supported Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) Sentinel Surveillance System (HBSSS) in 8 national and regional referral Mbale, Naguru, Mulago , Lacor This evaluation report therefore examines the work that was implemented, success stories, challenges and provides recommendations for future vaccine safety implementation strategies."
"Thus, for EUL vaccines it is very important to set up rigorous vaccine safety surveillance systems to detect known and new vaccine safety signals, investigate and respond to ensure safety of the population and maintain public confidence."
"Three phases were followed: Phase one included using an already-drafted surveillance program logic model and evaluation questions, to develop an evaluation protocol and interview guides."
"Interview guides (n=3) were tailored to the facility-level, district/regionallevel, and national-level stakeholders that participate in vaccine safety."
"The study participants were health workers at the different levels of health system from the national to the sub-national level who had been supporting the AEFI/AESI surveillance system and therefore, these were adults above 18 years of age."
"In addition, since all our respondents were health workers at the different levels of health system, all our data tools were designed in English and there was no need to interpret the tools in any local language since health workers use English as a mode of communication."

"National AEFI committee Independently review AEFI/AESI data and advise MOH Conduct review and classification of all serious AEFI Sampling technique and procedures A purposive sampling method was used to recruit 60 total participants for interviews, representing each stakeholder level: national, regional/district, and facility."
"Stakeholders that were identified at each level included: National  representatives from the National AEFI Committee, WHO, UNEPI, NDA, CDC/AFENET, national surveillance study coordinators and Director Public Health-MOH."
"Desk review was used to capture baseline data on vaccine safety surveillance, CDC GIST financial support prior to and during HBSSS implementation, and other donor-financial support."
"We focused on the section named safety indicators and reviewed all the indicators under this section namely: availability of a vaccine adverse events review committee, availability of a national system to monitor adverse events following immunization, number of total adverse events, including suspected or confirmed reported to the national level, of the total adverse events reported, Key informant interview (KII) guides were used to capture qualitative data to gain detailed understanding of All data collected was kept by the data manager on a hard drive using a password protected computer."
Key Informant Interview (KII) data was recorded and transcribed.
Data from interviews was coded iteratively using an inductive approach.
ATLAS Ti software was used to facilitate coding and analysis of data.
Stakeholder engagement meetings will be held for dissemination of findings and discussion on how these findings can inform immunization safety monitoring in-country.
This evaluation activity is expected to generate vital information on the benefits of conducting and future considerations for AESI surveillance.
"Reporting and dissemination of results Reports were compiled by the evaluators and will be shared with key stakeholders, including the local and national authorities, global stakeholders, and expert committees."
Permission was sought from the directors of the selected regional referral of the study and its objectives.
Participants were informed of their rights to refuse or withdraw at any time during the interview.
The respondents were free to respond to questions they wanted to respond and were not coerced to answer any question.
Anonymity was guaranteed by not writing participants names.
Confidentiality: Data was kept confidential with no identifying personal information available to staff.
Personal information was not used in data analysis or any publications/presentations of this assessment.
Original questionnaires (paper-based) was kept in a locked cabinet in a secure room.
Computerized data was kept on password-protected computers.
"The desk review showed that the country was unable to capture safety indicators for the year 2020, probably due to none reporting likely to have been contributed by the Covid-19 pandemic and lock down; the following years (2021, 2022 and 2023) show that the country had a vaccine adverse events review committee that was well constituted and operational, and a national system to monitor adverse events following immunization."
"These included the catchment area (in terms of size/volumes of the population served), the existing AEFI surveillance systems at different the selected health facilities were geographically distributed (north, west, east and central as well as urban versus rural) across the country to ensure representation, but also that they had the diagnostic capacity/ infrastructure (staffing and facilities) that can support the conduct of the needed medical investigations."
"We had to pick a facility from the different regions like in West Nile, we had to pick a facility to represent West Nile region, we went to western region and we picked Kabale, we went to the East and we picked Soroti, also from the engagement that we requested to include private facilities that is to say PNFPs like Rubaga and Lacor because initially the protocol was only looking at public facilities [National]."
"In addition to these factors, informed by the engagement with various stakeholders, a few private facilities were also included in order to ensure the private sector representativeness and perspective."
At least to take in the demographics that are likely to attend private facilities compared to that go to government facilities so that it brings in that number being private facilities [National].
"Training of Sentinel site teams/staff There was training on case definitions, detection and management offered to all those that were selected to be involved in the project."
The training was primarily before the start of the project and was supplemented by an on-job training especially for the members that joined the site team later.
This training mainly resulted into knowledge acquisition especially on: importance of vaccines and vaccine safety surveillance; elaborated COVID-19 signs and symptoms; case presentation using the Brighton level criterion level of certainty; different adverse events of special interest; follow up of patients with adverse events following vaccination; how the causality assessment is conducted (the whole process).
"But when Iwas taken through the training, when these people used to come [name], Iwas so keen with now these people, like whoever would come and complain, who had a complaint related to what is in the project, Iwould go deeper [Nurse]."
"Reflecting on the training process, participants also reported on what could have been improved saying that it should have been started earlier; should have lasted longer to allow comprehensive understanding; and incorporating in refresher courses to keep them updated would have been helpful in keeping them updated."
"To achieve these, other processes such as the site team meetings, medical chart reviews, follow up investigation and medical support for the patient were conducted."
"Only the AESI case detection, vaccination status determination, reporting, causality assessments processes This was the first step."
Eligible prospective patients were screened for or identified for an AESI condition during triaging when they presented themselves at the interest.
"What worked well was starting with taking history, to see whether immunization was involved, followed by confirmation of the vaccination status and other medical investigations for a diagnosis."
Building rapport with the patient was key.
"Otherwise, not until theyve told you Ive had my immunization that was when Istarted getting this, probably it could be one reason that brought them to them or do the assessment, thats when you are able to get it [Nurse] For the retrospective surveillance, following patients records on the adverse events, patient files would be retrieved, studied and data extracted."
This part of the process was described as difficult due to missing information (as detailed in the challenges section).
Findings indicated that the kind of challenges that were commonly encountered were that most patients did not have their vaccination cards with them when they came to the health facilities and would only always tell/notify with word of mouth which was quite hard to prove.
Contact numbers were also used to follow up patients where this information was not available at the health facilities or national vaccination system.
"Following up patients was described as difficult highlighting scenarios of the teams going to the communities and bouncing back, making it a back and forth sometimes."
"After identifying a possible AESI at the health facility, it was fully documented as much as possible and reported using the provided tools including using ODK for consideration by the causality assessment committee."
"Causality Assessment process Overall, several process including case detections, case notification/reporting, investigation and analysis, record keeping, feedback were involved in the causality assessment."
"At the facility level, the site team assessed the patients biodata including their full details such as their contact/addresses, next of kin contacts, and whether the necessary tests have been/were conducted or requested."
"In the process, the counseling of the patients in case of fear and anxiety and any other support in treatments may be offered."
"Key information needed for causality assessment Firstly, one of the key pieces of information in the investigation was the vaccination status that if available made the casualty assessment go smooth."
It is smooth when all the information required in the file about the client is available.
You need to have the COVID-19 vaccination card.
"Because when you are inputting this information, in ODK, one of the compulsory pieces of information required is the vaccination information [Site leader]."
"In addition to the vaccination card, the other information that was needed to make the assessment go smooth was availability of other personal data such as national identification card, address/ contact (phone and village) as well as major medical/laboratory investigations (both the basic and complicated procedure) attached."
"Absence of such investigations meant that the case could be lost, or review and decisions delayed since some of the investigation maybe done late or never be possible in the instance that the patient died It is smooth when all the investigations required from the client is also done and updated within the file."
"You discuss and reach somewhere, you find that, there is some information required from the patient especially investigation but is not there, it becomes a challenge, especially when you are updating the Brightons level of certainty...sometimes you may not be able to follow up the client."
"You call, the clients phone is off."
The client is already discharged or has died.
"For assessments, if we dont have full data of the patient, we kind of get stuck."
"If investigations are not fully recorded or not done or no results attached, its quite hard to conclude."
"It is easy when you have all the full details of what is needed, the vaccination card is available, the investigation or supportive investigation is done with results attached [ Most often missing data/information: It is important to note that full patient details were often missing making the process a prolonged go back and forth with most of the cases during causality."
"It was common, especially in the retrospective process/ surveillance, that most of them were lacking or were conducted, but poorly recorded or not attached to the patients data."
"They described a scenario where the laboratory results are requested using a different form, conducted in the laboratory where they are reclaimed by a patient, and then re-written in the patient notes which overall, create huge risks for data gaps in the process."
"It was mostly investigations sometimes times they might be done but not attached to the files, so its quite hard to see."
"A test is done, but the results are not attached, or the major tests not done."
"So, if its re-written in the notes and the patient claims the results, its hard [ The other data that was commonly missing was the vaccination cards and patient addresses/location."
"Participants indicated that for most patients, besides their names, age and sex, the address contacts were sometimes wrong information that did not belong to a patient, or not available for instance the phone numbers."
"In some instances, the available contacts were for others close to the patient which was difficult especially when disclosing the information would be harmful to the patient."
"Factors that were found to be important facilitators for the successful implementation of this surveillance dedicated stakeholders including staff that were motivated, ,  learning sessions through the causality reviews, , coordination and reporting (feedback and coordination meetings)."
Motivated by the need to fill the gap Buy  in was also another facilitator for the project.
There were  high expectations from the national (MOH) and health facilities involved about the project impact.
There was full interest and participation of the health facilities and staff that was engaged in the study which was very key in the implementation of the project.
"It was reported that the buy-in by stakeholders was because they appreciated it as an area of concern and were therefore driven by the need to contribute to evidence that could fill the gap created by the vaccine misinformation, fear and rumours."
"There was already a need and there was interest about the problem that was being heard in the public, so meaning they were interested in getting to know and see really how they identify these cases which have been talked about by other people, and they are part of the process of reviewing, documenting, confirming and presenting about them, yes those are the key things that worked out during the trainings [National Some of the participants were motivated by their reported great expertise based on their experience from other research engagements, thus become very resourceful to the HBSSS project."
Funding and Financial motivation The HBSSS project had a specific budget dedicated to its implementation even if the activities were conducted alongside the routine health services.
All participants indicated that financial motivation was very key for the
Timely financial motivation for the facilitation towards the site meetings logistics was critical in the success of the project.
"This motivation of the site teams was associated with their improved attitudes towards conducting project tasks alongside other when you motivate data collectors or the study team participants in real time and routinely and they know the timelines, it makes things very easy."
"And these are some of the things we have done because we have been able to disperse their allowances on time, and moderate support just for their refreshments for their meetings [National level]."
It was also noted that having an opportunity for the virtual attendance at the review meetings facilitated the members who could not attend physically to make contribution to the review process.
"This was noted as critical component since the must attend at the physical attendance at meetings and related travel in the beginnings of the project were constraining some members given that they also needed to attend to other it goes well when you convene the causality [review assessment]to a place of their convenience, and when they are facilitated to be therethese are people with big businesses and activities that they are doing on a day to day to earn, so they must be assured that the facilitation is available for catering for their allowances and their honorarias for the days for the sessions that they are attending [National level]."
Simplified tools eased the process There was a general perception among the key informants that the case definition and the tools and all the relevant materials that were used at the sites were simplified which made the data collection and reporting process easier since they were new to most of the site teams.
"In particular, the teams noted that the Brightons criteria were not only new and exciting but was also simple to use compared to other they had experienced before."
"In relation to the tools, participants indicated that although some processes such as data abstraction was"
Evidence in the national databases Another factor that was reported to have facilitated the process was the availability of databases at the national level (national database for COVID-19 vaccination) which were critical in the confirmation/validation of the individuals vaccination status.
These databases especially the EPIVAC system (the national COVID-19 Vaccination portal) were especially useful in situations when the vaccination cards were not available or accessible to confirm the vaccination status.
Training of good quality/ well conducted It was reported that the training (of the data collectors or the study team) was of good quality and was well perceived which contributed to positive expectations regarding the project outcome and process.
"In particular, participants indicated that the training was of high interest to the team, engaging and introduced new aspects such as the Bridgtons criteria of assessing vaccine related adverse events, the reporting of adverse events, comprehensive COVID-19 information, case presentation and follow up among others."
"The other component that participants felt made the training of good quality was mode, in particular the face-to-face training."
"Participants felt that convening the different team in central points including Kampala, Jinja among others for the face-to-face sessions enabled better learning than if the virtual training was used."
A good coordination system was one of factors described as a success of the project.
"And then the very responsible persons in the had the contact persons or leads, and those leads would then become a useful linkage, so that has what worked well, the coordination was very good [National level]."
"Several stakeholders involved in the HBSSS project From the findings, several partners were involved and supported different activities of the project."
"Generally, it was reported that most partners were providing key support in creating an enabling environment for the project to succeed including overall coordination and oversight, legal and pharmacovigilance expertise by the NDA, availing facilitation/allowances for the study teams, as well as support in terms of vehicles and finances for fuel and other logistical support."
"We have made presentations and data, evidence-based information to the stakeholders and these stakeholders range from the funders, CDC team, we also have teams from WHO, we have teams from AFENET, then the teams from MOH, UNEPI, then also stakeholders like the AEFI National Causality committee, then WHO provides technical support especially when developing policies; also provide financial support for investigations and also technical expertise with need of any safety follow up of vaccines [National]."
Stakeholder engagement was good overall The different stakeholder engagement activities which many participants highly appreciated that they were timely intensive and comprehensive included presentations at various stages of the project from initial consultations (starting from inception phase) to updates and feedback sessions to share evidence and progress.
"Importantly, the directors of the different site teams that were trained which was a very strong point not only for the initial processes but also the whole project implementation."
That gave us a very good leverageto routinely share gaps early enough so that remedial actions are put in place before they escalate to higher level [National level].
"Yes, the directors of the identification of the teams that were to be trained because they are the ones who identified for us the people we trained [National level]."
"Progress meetings and coordination activities (between the causality committee, national level, and the sites) were key in keeping stakeholders abreast with the site-specific progress and needs which deepened their interest and involvement with the project."
"We went ahead and made preliminary [conference]presentations to other external stakeholders, so that is equally engaging the stakeholders and keeping them a breast with information about the study [National level]."
The key informants also felt that the stakeholder engagement was good since all the concerns that arose and needed responses were considered and addressed in time while keeping all the stakeholders up to date.
This was in addition to the monthly and annual progressive reports that were given to certain key stakeholders depending on the type of the information.
"Stakeholders engagements were conducted at many levels including the regional level, and DHOs, MOH, NDA, AEFI committee, CDC attended."
Participants empathized that the project should have included and prioritized all of stakeholders according to their roles stating the regulatory component of the vaccine safety surveillance which they felt was somehow limited.
"Then suddenly [a more personal experience], Imean, it is interesting but so, Iwould say , Ithink it could have In addition, community engagement activities were reportedly not conducted well which presented some challenges during the tracking/follow up."
A mismatch between community and project expectations were reported which participants believed would have been avoided by comprehensive community engagement.
"When you go, they expect you to maybe offer them their transport, and yet when you reach there, after finishing engagement, all you to do is appreciate them."
"So, it was challenging."
It was challenging [Data manager].
"Challenges faced and solutions during the project implementation The key challenges that were faced include: Site team changes and drops There were reports of some team members leaving/dropping off due to delayed financial allowances for the project sites teams, an issue that affected the team composition in some sites."
Discrepancies between the perceived or promised versus the actual financial motivation was reported.
"People could not be able to continue, we persisted for 4 months, then people gave up...we went there when we were 13, but time came when we remained only 5 [ others the motivation, the money delayed coming in, those who lost interest."
"So, the attrition rate was high and am saying this from the experience of the support supervision, you go there at regional referrals, trained like 10 people, but you only find 3 of the original people [national]."
"Besides the financial challenges, there were reports that some health workers dropped off due to failure to balance their regular workload with additional surveillance project activities."
"For some health facilities, the team changes were due to changes such as a member leaving we had a high attrition rate whereby participants who were trained fell off during the implementation phase...loss of interest, others being changed within facilities because you know when we were selecting, we wanted those who were representative and others would change, others were claiming the workload was 2."
Poor data quality and missing information One of the biggest challenges encountered during the study was an issue of poor-quality data systems especially the issue of missing or scanty information which affected the project negatively by delaying the retrospective case tracking and review process.
Some basic demographic information such as sex and contact numbers missing in the patients records were reported.
Also missing key information such as the medical/ laboratory investigations and vaccination card (were either lost or poorly recorded or not yet in the national vaccine database) was a key challenge that made it difficult to ascertain whether a patient had received a vaccine or not [cross ref for details in the Causality Assessment process subheading]
The data capture in the primary data collection tools in our sites is still a very big gap [National level].
"So, this was a bit of a challenge."
You know most of the cases were retrospective and charts would lack some information...this affected the process of looking at the real cases.
"So, these are some of the challenges that we have encountered in the process Such poor-quality data was linked to many missed opportunities in case detection."
Below is a long extract that shows a scenario where difficulties in a vaccination status confirmation related to information gaps leaving out a potential case.
"But for the ones where they dont have a card, in the system they are missing, we would now definitely leave them out."
"Though there is one case, up to today we still feel convinced that actually it would be true that hes eligible and should be in the study, we have tried all meansbecause we feel surely, he might be one of the cases, though it is just the COVID-19 status, which is a block to that."
"It came in a bit later, but in the initial stages, follow-up was a challenge, the support, it was not forthcoming."
"So, we relied basically on what we have."
"If the patients file is adequate enough, with the information, we go with that."
"Or phone call, that is the most we would go."
"But later on, the follow-up support came in, there was fuel provided, and some facilitation support started moving to villages and other districts to check these people [data manager]."
"Limited investigation capacity at site In line with poor record keeping system, key medical investigations which would have been useful in review and decision-making processes were largely missing, either because they were not conducted, or they were conducted and not properly recorded."
Such limitations in the capacity at investigations to confirm/validate the conditions were noted as one of the key challenges.
Oversight in information gathering was reported even when the study was structured.
"Overall, the participants were concerned that the country has a very poor record keeping culture that there was no system to tract the persons health challenges/history before the vaccination versus what happened after vaccination."
"So, the time when we should have really done the required investigation, they were not done, so you want to do them now."
Icall it going backwards and therefore you may not pick the exact parameters that you want.
"Imagine somebody was vaccinated 6 months ago presented with a rush a day after the vaccination, then they keep quiet, or it is treated as any other popular rash, but it persists, then we"
"So, the evidence has gaps because the investigation that could have been done were not actually done [Medical Office]."
"The history still posed a problem, and missing investigations remained an issue that is a very major issue of data in this country, from what Ive experienced, it is really a challenge [National level]."
"The reliance on private health facilities was however very inefficient and presented difficult situations in cases where the investigations including C-Tscans, D-dima were too expensive beyond what most patients could afford."
"But now challenges come when maybe they cannot afford like a C-Tscan, like D-dima, those ones are expensive, yeah."
"So, investigations, finances [ some investigation like d-dimer, that test is not done in the the test, because you tell the patient to go and do the test from outside that it is expensive 50,000ugx and above."
"So, the patient could tell you that Idont have the money, it was a challenge [Laboratory Staff]."
"The lack of key medical information sometimes resulted into major delays, the missing out (leaving out) some potential cases and or documentation of only personal accounts which were generally biased or confusing."
An instance where two care takers of a baby patient gave 2 different accounts of the situation was reported.
"Besides, the patient verbal reports, there were challenges of lack of coordination between the patient, the patient and the health workers) in the whole patient follow process."
"One time Iremember [health facility name], but the father was giving different information from the mother, that made our work a little challenging."
"Ithink, the doctor who was supposed to sign on the letter was not there - had left it to the interns."
"So those are some of the challenges, the missing investigations required to ascertain the Brightons level is what is mostly a challenge [Records Assistant]."
"Transport facilitation needs/inadequacies It was reported that transport costs were sometimes needed during processes for confirming the vaccination status, or other investigations to confirm a condition."
The transport was especially needed during medical investigations for the patients who were living far/long distances from the site where the capacity of the
"Such transportation costs in terms of the time, vehicle, and the money for fuel, although they were later in the project provided for, significantly delayed the process of investigations and reviews."
"The other one is also its not easy, we had to mobilize the pathologists from Kampala to go and travel everywhere and sometimes it causes delay, so those are the major challenges that were mainly logistical and reporting 5."
"Even when the teams kept learning lessons on how to do better their work alongside the HBSSS project activities including changes in the meeting schedules to less frequent compared to when they started, a report of so busy days with extended working into late nights for some of them was reported."
"For some of them, a focus on their routine work meant it was especially difficult for them to achieve/progress well on the HBSSS project."
"For example, some members described how they could have missed potential cases if they are in one ward due to being in different ward for a routine task for example."
"This means the other work is pending, because we usually meet, we had scheduled every Thursday."
"We first meet, before we can go to our units respective [Team Leader]."
"It was okay the only challenge could have been the fact that sometimes you are in a different ward, you cant be everywhere all the time."
"So, if someone not trained or oriented to it receives that case in your absence, they may treat it as any other case and let it go."
"In relation to workload challenges, there were reported delays in reporting and causality review processes/ meetings."
There was a feeling of difficulty in convening causality assessment meetings/committee because of the various engagement of the members of the committee members (conflicting time demands/priorities outside the HBSSS project).
It was also reported that there was delayed reporting and presentation of cases which affected the surveillance process including investigations.
"The reporting comes but it comes late to us and the committee, so by the time you go to investigate or send in investigators, many times, the event has already dissolvedand so you cant make a good objective assessment [National level]."
"Ithink causality assessment goes smoothly when you have all the information, one, when they come early, when the case is presented early enough."
"I think they were reported late, when they are reported late the events have long gone and the investigators go when the patience has recovered long time ago."
"So, when they report such cases you cant make sense of it, of what the case was, so that issue of delayed investigations Discrepancies in the protocol were also reported to have been a challenge at some point."
Some people felt that the data collection tool at the facility level was not in harmony with the criteria that the national review committee was using during the review meeting.
"They noted that while the Brightons criteria were used at the health facility level, the assessment committees and other partners especially the national drug authority used a different approach/criteria."
"So, the information used by the project to qualify the events as AESI or AFI was different when we went for causality assessment meetings."
"Thats where Ialways felt that they needed to harmonize the tool, protocol so that when we enter things in, we know that we are at per [Medical Officer]."
"So, their criteria were different, yes."
It created a discrepancy between what we were qualifying here and what they were qualifying the other side.
"So, there is need to harmonize those two [Medical Officer]."
"Discrepancies were also indicated in the lack of harmonisation in the reporting system for the adverse events, especially in the early phase of the project, which was reported by some participants."
"Participants described scenarios where some patients may report directly to the health facilities while others may call/report to the regulatory authority (NDA), highlighting the need for mechanisms that ensure that no events go missing or unattended to."
Misinformation and rumours created community resistance Misinformation was one of the key challenges that were faced during the HBBSS implementation process.
Various rumours were reported including those that spread on social media which created a lot of hesitancy and mistrust from the community towards effective engagement with anything related with COVID-19.
"Generally, many people had concerns about COVID-19 as a disease as well as the COVID-19 vaccine with some community members believing that every health issues they experienced were linked to the vaccine."
Ithink the challenges were that there was a lot of miss information and disinformation.
Even things which were known as other diseases or infection were being attributed to vaccines.
"Somebody would get an illness and say because you vaccinated me, that is why Iam feeling this illness they have concern and look out for vaccine safety issues because they live in the community."
"There is usually some fear about what will the vaccine cause, what will happen or hearing rumour?"
It was noted that peoples experiences with several rumours on the vaccine negatively affected how they perceived any investigation (had doubt about many tests) that was being conducted by the health facilities including the HBSSS project.
"For example, key informants described several scenarios of hesitancy to provide individual COVID-19 vaccine related information among the community members including failure to say whether they had been vaccinated or not or disappearing on the day of the appointment for a certain needed investigation follow up."
"You make appointment with a client or the next of kin, the attendants, [but you] will find they have escaped."
"Like theres one GBS which Igot on the ward after interacting with them, they say that the card is at home...but when Iinteracted with them afterwards, going [community] the following day, Ifound that they had run away."
So those are the scenarios [Records Assistant].
Delayed surveillance process and reduced risk perception There were concerns that the surveillance activities of the HBSSS project although relevant started later than was necessary.
"Having started in 2022, compared to when the vaccination started (during 2021, 2020), this surveillance project delay made it difficult to track all the cases, most of which were poorly documented."
"Besides having to track all the cases retrospectively since the vaccination had scaled down, risk perception had reduced and there was already misinformation regarding the vaccines which altogether affected the HBSSS processes including the case tracking."
Key informants felt that the community was not well informed on the need for the surveillance aspect of the COVID-19 vaccine  a vaccine that was administered in the past compared to the HBSSS project.
"In addition, there were due to limited finances, some gaps in the dissemination aspect whereby participants felt that the community did not get an opportunity to receive feedback from the decisions on some of the investigated cases."
"Ithink the community aspects in terms of advocacy [lacked], Ithink we didnt have strong sufficient advocacy at the community level to make people understand the importance of why we ask them questions for things that happened already and sometimes they dont even report [National level]."
"Then feedback to the community when an investigation happens is also an issue, we never get to hear what happened."
"If they report that the child was vaccinated and got a problem and the causality assessment is done, the report is not disseminated back to the community."
"That this is actually what caused the event so, that kind of promotes the hesitancy here and the rumours because they are never verified, or if they are, the information is never given to the community [ Overall, there were reports on challenges related to inadequacies in the finances/funding aspect of the project which of course was a foundation to a significant part of the challenges described in this section."
"Such challenges affected the causality assessment meetings in a way that it was associated with a backlog for the the challenges were quite a numberthe committee at one point had a lot of backlogs for assessing and so on, and [names partner], there was some kind of misalignment between the stakeholders on how to get these people funded and be able to do their work to clear that back log."
"Up to now, Ithink it is still there so thats one of the challenges [Surveillance officer]."
"Additionally, sometimes people think they need to be compensated for damages or other related issues, but we dont have the funding to cover that [National]."
Key solutions implemented to address the challenges Flexibility in schedules and meetings Fitting causality assessments reviews within the schedule of the review committee with WHO focal point assistance was one of the solutions to ensure that the committees members attended.
The scheduling with which was key in time saving and attendance.
"Our secretariat members are willing to work in both modes, which means we dont always have to be physically present to address issues."
That flexibility has been the most important factor for me [National].
Support supervision and coordination process Most participants reported that routine support supervision was enhanced which was key in identifying gaps and addressing them accordingly in process.
"In addition, the national UNEPI vaccine system was leveraged creation of the coordination platform."
"After data analysis, we share the feedback instantly on the progress and give information where theres a gap and we can address that [National level]."
Training new team members The challenge of changes in team composition/attrition due to several reasons was solved by training of new health workers to join the team.
"It was reported that especially during the causality assessment meetings, site team leads were encouraged to train and fill up the teams."
"However, although the training for replacements was on job and hands on, there were reports from some of those that were trained that the training was short leaving them not feeling equipped well enough in time."
Facilitating patient follow up Findings indicate that fuel for the information was later provided to the into their communities was noted when most cases that were presented at the review meetings were sometimes disqualified or delayed due to lack of evidence especially the expensive medical investigations.
"In some instances, the medical experts were transported to the communities, and for the patients, the medical investigations were supported."
"Financing all the necessary investigations where the patient was unable to or cost sharing with the patients where they could afford some part of the cots was reported as one of the key solutions that enabled the project to deal with the missing information/investigations and the related we had to give support, fuel to the sites to do follow up of the cases within their regional coverage, so this one has helped us a lot because the sites could follow up the cases physically, drive there, see the cases, and probably get the information from the cases at their homes [National level]."
"And the other thing was also the support to the cases to do some laboratory and radiological investigations, because when they were making presentations, we identified that cases were being dropped because they lacked evidence of laboratory and radiology resultswe could support the investigation either 100% for those who completely cant afford, or we cost share with the case."
Phone numbers and addresses were used to track patients in their communities to confirm their vaccination status.
Impact- benefits of HBSSS project implementation Findings indicate some impact on the health facilities and community as described in the different key benefits the participants felt that can be attributed to the project.
"These are related to timely reporting and investigation of suspected AEFI, increase in number of AEFI reports, staff knowledge about vaccine safety surveillance and improved patient care."
A great improvement in the skills/abilities for the presentation of cases to the review committee compared to when they began was reported which was a key indicator for increased technical capacity in surveillance of vaccine safety.
"For some of them, it was their first time engaging with the causality committees."
"And it was really a challenge at the start, but in the process, the committee did mentorship and built their capacity, and this has improved over time [National level]."
"These health workers involved in this activity were believed by participants to be critical in future as trainers of trainees needed for the continuation of the HBSSS, a similar project or a surveillance system."
It is important to note that the project was reportedly an opportunity for the capacity building for not only the and causality review/assessment committees.
"It was reported that the HBSSS project experience and lessons added a lot of momentum to other surveillance and causality assessment work, improved information transmission, and enhanced preparation for other pandemics."
"The lessons from COVID-19 have been invaluable for strengthening routine immunization, which is the best way to prepare for pandemics."
Increased awareness and reports on adverse events It was noted that the awareness on adverse events and the need to report them had increased.
"Even though it was with a selected team, there has been collaboration"
Some of the site team members had engaged their community members in informal advice setting encouraging them to report any complaint they thought was related to COVID-19 vaccine.
"Iwould just advise them whoever would complain, even in my village, Iwould just advise them, you go to the and so you never know, maybe you might be one of them and we can easily cure it [Nurse]."
"So, Ithink that aspect of community sensitization to make sure that in case they realize something maybe happening, they can know where to go and where to report it [Data manager] Some improved patient care was also reported by participants who expected that it would have been greater if the project had started earlier along the initial COVID-19 vaccination activities."
The reported improvement in the care for patients was partly linked to the need of improved data management and investigations during the review/surveillance process.
"The same diligence was said to be happening in terms of other different patient data, and beyond the site teams that were directly involved this research also improved on the health care delivery."
There are some of the investigations they were sometimes neglecting.
"So, when a case is found, thorough investigation is done on a patient before the case is part of the study [Records Officer]."
Ifeel it has greatly impacted the accuracy of the information.
The back-and-forth movement in the process makes people realize the importance of certain data that should have been collected.
"Its retrospective, kind of like a post-mortem, but if it was prospective, even the patient being monitored would benefit because the necessary data would be collected in real-time.... going forward, Ithink it has truly made an impact, but it would be more effective if it was done deliberately from the start [National level]."
"On the other hand, a few participants felt that the observed improvement in data collection and patient care was driven by the need to have data for the causality assessment committee and not an improvement in the actual health care."
"Similarly, although knowledge was said to have increased to some extent, some gaps were reported sending mixed reactions."
"So, Ido not think it has made a very, very big difference [National]."
"There have been gains, but the challenge remains in utilizing the data effectively."
"Were generating a lot of data, but the capacity to use it is still lacking."
"Thats why Imentioned the importance of training health workers on how to better use the data [ Ithink the training has helped, the knowledge they have gained is supposed to be there, because Iknow logistics have now gone down but the knowledge at least and the awareness of the health workers has improved so we are now trying to put in place our own systems to keep the process on going [Director]."
Proof of vaccine safety surveillance feasibility One of the successes that participants felt was key was that the protocol was fully implemented well in reference to time and deliverables and emphasized that what remained was the need to go beyond the project phase.
"The lessons from the implementation itself offered an opportunity to understand the information that can inform not only continuity, but also scale up of the HBSSS or a similar project to other health facilities (details are described in the section on Feasibility And Sustainability Of Using HBSSS below."
"Idont think there is anything left [undone], we have thoroughly tried to exhaust it in line with our protocol, and in line with our protocol, we have exhausted what we were supposed to do [National level]."
"What remains now is to see how we can scale up, because for me, its like a proof of concept  we have shown that it is possible."
The next step is figuring out how to expand this to other mindset change in other people [National level].
"Many participants recommended that the active surveillance for vaccine safety should be routinely done at on adverse events of special interest, but also track patients complaints and forward them to the concerned persons/offices to proactively address them."
"Scale up the active vaccine safety surveillance justified As earlier noted, findings indicate that participants strongly felt that active vaccine safety surveillance should not only be continued beyond this project into a routine health service, but also scaled up to other"
"They strongly noted that such a safety surveillance activity is very relevant as it enables the needed understanding of vaccine efficacy, and peoples illegibility and safety given the increase in vaccine technology and products."
"They emphasized that as long as there are new vaccines, there is need to keep a track of what is happening to be able to support both learning and early preparations of the health workers, but also feedback to the community as their feelings about one vaccine can impact any vaccine, overall."
"Such consequences can have a backsliding effect on all the efforts of promoting vaccines, thus leaving communities unprotected."
"We need it because through surveillance, we can see the efficacy of the vaccine, and what may happen, and people who could be eligible."
It is very necessary to scale it up.
"It is key [ Timely adverse events tracking is easier than retrospective approaches: In their justification for scale up, participants stressed the importance of focusing on ensuring that the vaccine safety surveillance is started on time/earlier stages of vaccination in order not to miss any cases."
"They noted that scaling up the HBSSS activities, offers an opportunity to avoid most challenges of delayed protocol development and approval, delayed surveillance and reliance on the retrospective approach which, based on their experience and lessons from this HBSSS project, they reported was a bit difficult to implement."
Iwould think if there is plan of introduction of any new vaccine it starts early enough because retrospective data collection is very challenging and also approval of protocol usually takes time because we had a challenge when the HBSSS was approved vaccination had already gone down [National].
Controlling vaccine hesitancy An opportunity to control for vaccine hesitancy was reported as one of the important benefits that scaling up active and timely surveillance brings to the health system.
"Participants noted that although it requires extensive resources, the active surveillance is relevant in advancing benefits, access and coverage of vaccines by reducing the negative influences of vaccine hesitancy."
"The study lessons showed that rampant hesitancy was partly attributed to lack of such vaccine safety surveillance activities that when conducted not only create a sense of patient care (when they are followed up), but also promotes knowledge, and trust in the vaccines."
"Some of the participants strongly advised that there should not be any vaccination (because it would be not useful), if there cant be active safety surveillance for it to generate evidence that not only improve vaccines safety, but also the related population confidence."
"As NDA, MOH or as government, we always call people lets vaccinate, but after vaccinating we dont follow them up, people continue to see that no one is following them up and that increases vaccine hesitancy especially for the new vaccines [National]."
For the first time that you have almost 8 Regional Referral vaccine.
"Well, the vaccines are safe, but the safety component has not been included so much 2) patients appreciate when you follow them up a parent on active surveillance, feel cared for when you call them"
Because all you know is that the adverse event may end up making more people not take up the vaccine....a big part of them because of fears and worries.
"The recommendations were related to ensuring sustainability of the gains, from the HBSSS project which were related to the need for improvements in human resources, capacity building, health data infrastructure, coordination and monitoring, budgeting/funding."
"Overall, scaling up the HBSS project activities into routine services was expected to ensure surveillance of all vaccines safety in a timely manner (and not long after the vaccination program begins)."
"The scaling up requires several factors to be developed or addressed as described in the following subheadings: Orient other health facilities In relation to scaling up, other health facilities that were not involved in the study would require adequate orientation on what is involved and the implications (in time of benefits and resources involved)."
"It is important to scale up because not all cases that we receive were vaccinated from here, we work from Eastern Region, Elgon zone, where we serve about 14 districts and one city."
"We could spot some health facilities with a bit much population and go and orient them on what is happening on vaccine efficacy and hesitancy, and how to health educate the clients when they come [Records."
Empower frontline workers: Participants indicated a strong need to develop/strengthen human resource in charge of the active vaccine safety surveillance.
"They should be able to take samples, fill the forms, building the capacity of the health care workers at the who are managing these people, those are the ones whose capacity need to be built [National]."
"While there may be some capacity, its not strong enough for us to be fully confident in our vaccine safety effortsbecause people will say; this is extra work."
"So, Ithink there is a need for the MOH to consider this since it is a new component."
"Someone should be hired for this particular work, not as an additionaland that recommendation should really come out clearly [National]."
"Additionally, sometimes people think they need to be compensated for damages or other related issues, but we dont have the Refresher and other courses are needed Refresher courses were another key issue that study participants raised concerning efforts to ensure scale up of surveillance."
"Iwould say more trainings should be conducted because it was conducted at the beginning, and this was a 2- year project."
"You are engaged in other activities so you find you might have used other criteria, so at least there should have been another training in between [Laboratory]."
Idont think they missed out anything except the fact that the project has taken about 2 years.
"They would have only added like a refresher course along the way to bring peoples minds back because some of the cases were really rare like you dont even see them at times so when they get like one, if you not up to date, you might miss out [Medical Doctor]."
"Iwould recommend a continuous training, if you have done initial training then maybe as the evaluation is going on, like after four months, and six months [National]."
Training duration that provides extended/adequate training days were recommended.
"Specifically, it was recommended that refresher courses and other training such as the one that was conducted at the start of"
They described the training in the HBSSS project as rushed and felt that it would have been good if the training days were extended to ensure more room for the comprehensive material and diseases that were discussed.
"With 13 ESIs, going through extensive content in just four days, it might have been beneficial to extend the duration slightly."
"The content covered was substantial, and there was a lot to learn in a limited time [National]."
Findings indicated a need for a multidisciplinary approach to vaccine safety surveillance to ensure that all the required perspectives are considered across a whole surveillance chain in future.
"For instance, there were suggestions for consideration of the legal, media and the social science expertise on the surveillance team."
A legal expert would offer the necessary support for dealing with the evolving legal issues that may arise along the adverse events in relation to vaccines.
It was suggested that such expertise could be incorporated in an ad-hoc manner working closely with the lead stakeholders.
"Iknow we have had support from the MOH - UNEPI and the AGs office to address those issues, but Ithink in future, we may have a stand-by legal team that can always help us."
We may need in the future to also have maybe a communications team because those have been our biggest weaknesses.
"We need to communicate better, have better funding, and then maybe the legal issues around vaccines."
Because these issues keep evolving [ Improve data infrastructure / capacity at health facilities Participants felt that scaling up requires building a resilient surveillance system that has highly improved data management tools and processes including considerations for digital data systems.
"Besides, going digital, participants recommended that the data collection and management system should be built with adequate capacity to not only enable automated processes, but also both retrospective and prospective case Ithink we need to train people better and then to put in place resilient systems to collect data on adverse events and may be going digital."
"Ithink that would be a good thing and having resilient mechanisms to collect data on any events that may occur [ the proper filling of the primary data collection tools needs to be highly improved and the improvement should be capturing all the data about these cases, any patient, regardless of being a case or not, because anybody may have interest about a given condition at a certain timeso the primary data collection tool should have all the details of this patientthe telephone numbers, next of kin contacts, so that it helps us in follow up and contact tracing [National]."
All participants strongly felt that improved data management system in which both quantitative and qualitative data expertise is adequate would be key in making data/evidence informed decisions and effectively communicating the risks and benefits of vaccines to the public.
"Further emphasizing the need for better data systems, they indicated that such efforts should include those focused on building a system that is not only of high quality to deliver credible data, but also user friendly to enable its effective use."
"For instance, they described how use of the SPT forms could potentially not improve the quality of the current project data."
So those are the areas we need to improve on [Team Leader].
"Based on the lessons from the HBSSS project implementation in line with ensuring that the necessary data is available and credible, some participants emphasized the need for data/investigation protocols."
They recommended that such protocols and guidelines should be comprehensive including aspects of herbal medicines (which is used by a significant fraction of the population in the country) in relation to vaccines.
Findings indicated that the generation and utilization of credible data is key in building community trust and improved vaccination program through increased vaccination coverage as well as costs.
It is important to keep the stakeholders well informed and share routine gaps that can be identified early enough so that remedial actions are put in place before escalating to a higher amount or higher level.
Early stakeholder engagement is key in ensure that priorities among stakeholder are harmonised and efforts and resources consolidated to adequately offer support to the process.
"Ithink for any program really the planning has to be adequate, even time and ensuring mobilizing stakeholders, if there are any delays it could have been from the competing priorities from the stakeholders"
"It was recommended that future engagements should include not only the technical arm, but also the media which reports indicated were largely missing."
"Ithink that maybe we need to have the stakeholders at the national level in the scientific technical part and then the general part which includes a wider spectrum of stakeholders including lay people and the media, so that they can have an idea about this surveillance, and Ithink also And the other one that was missing which Iremember very well was media."
"Maybe we deliberately didnt include them there because we thought they were going to do something, but they were not there [National]."
Provide for and implement community engagement Community is one of the key stakeholders in vaccine safety surveillance.
"Engaging the local structures and the public for instance through continuous education of communities about the vaccines including side effects is key in addressing the challenges related to misinformation, rumours and fears among the public."
This was based on a key example in the participants perception that vaccine regulation component was not given the priority and funds it required; a challenged that they felt stem beyond this HBSSS project to routine vaccine programs.
"There is a need to have a mechanism of how to continuously support the surveillance activities at all levels including prioritizing regulatory perspectives in all processes including systems and tools for monitoring, supervision and funding/resource mobilisation."
"Conduct continuous supervision and monitoring Besides the recommendation for improvements in the safety surveillance team, participants indicated a strong need for continuous support supervision, monitoring and evaluation in order to effectively implement, continuously monitor and improve the quality of the process and outcomes."
"It is important to however note that while this projects supervision was rated high but majority, a few participants had concerns on some inadequacies in the supervision process."
"One of the participants at national level noted; the support supervision, Ifelt it was not enough, we did like only two support supervision, but Ithink people need to be followed up to see what they are doing."
"They said that supervision should cover not only the staff performance, but also the cold chain and related logistics for vaccine programs to ensure that they are up to date and standard."
"They also noted that the supervision system/process should also particularly focus on ensuring that there is adequate support to ensure that the simple and user-friendly surveillance tools and data bases are not only available, but accessible and properly used by relevant stakeholders."
Such tools should be digital and designed to have all the needed information that is.
"The coordinators of the project should try to liaise with the MOH team in charge of the EPIVACsuch that it would be easy for us to access the vaccination status, if at all its there in the system, such that we would have more cases brought on board."
"Yes, that was a major challenge."
An example of integration by some countries in a similar setting of the low- and middle-income countries was highlighted.
Iam aware that some low- and middle-income countries have tried to integrate such programs into their
Integration requires some level of investment and a change in mindset to ensure that these programs are seen as feasible and necessary [National].
"Every involved in healthcare, must have a component of surveillance integrated into their work."
"Everyone should have it as their responsibility, from the nurse or the person doing triage to the Although integration could come with extra workload for health workers, and need for modification in the tools, it was perceived by many participants to be a best approach to scaling up active surveillance across the country."
They believed that integration into routine services would ensure that active surveillance is conducted across all vaccines and not only a few of them that have either funding or specific support.
"They also emphasized that integration should cut across all the process including actual implementation, supervision and monitoring as well as tools noting that the tools needed are developed by the HBSSS project already."
"Integration of course our human resources is limited, Ithink anyone who has looked at our system and has looked at the staffing knows there is a huge gap, there is an issue when it comes to human resources, but Ithink integration is critical because if the focus becomes on one disease, then that becomes an issue we maintain the elements, we integrate it in our plans, our workload systems whether its supervision, whether its reviewing the data, supporting the tools because we are now actually going towards digital for a lot of our surveillance work, its just integrating in our current workload [National]."
A further in put by stakeholders in put in form of dissemination meetings was suggested by one participant as one of the key beginning steps to further get their input into the best possibilities of continuity in an integrative way for active surveillance.
"Instead of centralizing everything in one location, like Lagos, we should have regional perspectives and learningsfrom the learnings of this study, we should be able to inform specific regions on how to handle these issues, including communication strategies."
Establish regional causality assessment committees Decentralisation would mean that the causality assessment is conducted at the regional level instead of only national level which would however require that the regional committees are trained and equipped with technical knowledge for the task.
"Besides ensuring that the regional perspectives are considered, regionalisation could result in timely causality assessment and risk communication (that is reduced delays"
"This would ensure that the regional team are as competent as the national team, with the only difference being the level at which they operate."
"You would know the outcome earlier, which would allow for timely responses, such as implementing risk communicationcurrently, if causality assessment takes three months due to data challenges and back-and-forth communication, it can delay the entire process, affecting the program and other related activities."
"The capacity should be the same to ensure that decisions made at the regional level, like in Karamoja, are not challenged elsewhere."
"It should meet international standards, but it would be beneficial to have this structure in place [National]."
"So, it should be extended to all throughout the health system [ recommend that we expand the number of sites and go to lower-level sites, not only Regional Referrals none of us prefer to go the Regional Referral, you only go there when things are bad so Iwould think in future protocols, they should think of representatives in the health centre 3 and 4 and general Invest in risk communication Participants believed that the financial investment for active safety surveillance activities should be accompanied by an investment in risk communication and feedback which is central in proving the community with the right information."
They noted that this requires a strategic plan informed by the understanding that presence (or lack of) vaccine safety surveillance information sharing can affect immunization programs at the national level.
"They emphasized the proactive measures including risk communication should therefore be put in place in a way that covers comprehensively both current issues and those that are likely to happen, considering upcoming vaccines like the malaria vaccine, which will also present adverse vaccine safety issues including the rampant misinformation."
We need to put in place measures to mitigate and contain these challenges so that our vaccination programs are not overrun.
Risk communication should follow once we have identified and understood
Another recommendation was related to sustainability measures as detailed in the section on [Sustainability Mechanisms for Active Safety Surveillance Benefits Need Improvement].
Sustainability mechanisms for active safety surveillance benefits need improvement Enhance existing sustainability efforts The national level participants reported that capacity building and sustainability considerations were embedded in the project activities and design.
It was also stated that sustainability issues were also discussed during various review and initial meetings with stakeholders.
"Relatedly, most national level participants felt that sustainability was assured given that the key foundations were set including the fact that the project team was not entirely newly hired, but rather part of the why we are saying that sustainability can be carried on, we have not employed any external person in the sites...we have been relying on the staff within the capacity now well built and them having formed a team being led by the community and public health to continuity of such related studies [Director]."
"Adequate financial investment in vaccine surveillance is needed The findings indicate that the scaling and integration process should ensure that a financial structure/ budget is in place to plan and detect vaccine related issues going forward, including prospectively identifying cases, conducting causal assessments, and public feedback or engagement."
"However, despite the reported considerations for capacity building and sustainability in the protocol in addition to the integration proposal by almost all participants, most of them were significantly worried and not confident about sustaining such programs especially in the low- and middle-income settings."
Most participants were largely sceptical about the sustainability of active safety surveillance in their indicated worry that the country lacks a laboratory infrastructure system that can offer the required diagnostic capacity/investigative capability for confirming the adverse events following vaccination.
Idont know if we have the infrastructure that is adequate to do the diagnostic investigative part of the investigation.
"In general, maintaining such programs without ongoing donor support is challenging, especially in countries with high disease burdens and limited resources [National]."
Most of the worry was associated to the perception that the surveillance process cannot largely be sustained for long if the HBSSS and related activities are totally dependent on external funding/donors.
Their worries were based on the fact that the HBSSS project was specifically funded and not entirely streamlined within the routine/usual health facility service.
"Icannot give you an answer on how we shall do it because these people have been getting facilitation, some small enumerations which usually comes after every three months and now who is going to do it?"
The support from CDC and WHO has been substantial.
One major objective was to develop a sustainability plan to continue the work once these organizations pull out.
"For critical programs like this, specific and deliberate investment is essential [National]."
"To address the potential challenges and threats towards sustainability, major recommendations that were made include the need for domestic investment and commitment for safety surveillance even with the meager financial health resources in the country."
"Such investments would address concerns that while funding was central to safety surveillance, it was largely inadequate."
So for me Ithink budget allocation for vaccine safety is the biggest driver that will allow how the vaccine and other things are continuing [National].
"Participants noted that beyond the physical infrastructure, financial commitment should aim to ensure workers could, if possible, work entirely on vaccine surveillance or provide more than 50% of their time dedicated to the same."
"At the district level, where we have primary healthcare focused on prevention, there must be an officer aligned with this role."
Ivote to really support prioritization of vaccine safety and allocate resources for that simply because the technology of vaccines has been very successful.
"Vaccine safety surveillance is crucialso it becomes very important to identify even the small, unwanted effects to put in place mitigation measures, risk communication, and to strengthen the immunization program [National]."
"There was a delay in the approval of the HBSSS project (submitted , approved 03 ) leading to late implementation."
"The HBSSS was perceived to have significant benefits, including increased awareness of vaccine safety surveillance even at the community level, enhanced capacity for monitoring vaccine safety, improved signal detection, more efficient reporting, and better patient care."
Expanding surveillance to additional health facilities is essential to maintain preparedness for both existing and emerging vaccine products and technologies.
Scaling up monitoring beyond adverse events of special interest to include all vaccine-related adverse effects is both relevant and timely.
Sustainability of active vaccine safety surveillance was perceived possible only if at least the same project funding is dedicated to the program a long side a better stakeholder mapping with clear roles.
"It is very key to plan and allocate the necessary resources, especially finance for diagnostic facilities and human resources to ensure that people whose primary deliverables include vaccine safety surveillance are available."
Integration of active vaccine safety surveillance was recommended including: Decentralization of causality assessment committee Community based vaccine safety surveillance (including lower health facilities since most people first contact these before they go to referral facilities).
"Overall, establishing a strategic and resilient national system for active vaccine safety surveillance is crucial for sustaining its benefits."
These includes aspects of ensuring that proactive measures are in place to respond to the old and new/emerging vaccine related diseases 9.
"Causality assessment is more efficient when cases are reported promptly and thoroughly investigated, including a complete history, detailed event chronology, and potential diagnoses Critical Investigations always delayed Laboratory investigations were difficult to conduct; thus some cases were missed."
"Although stakeholder engagement at the national and institutional level ( facilities, districts) was good, we recommend strengthening community engagement to include: 12."
Training including refresher course should be given adequate time to allow for comprehensive 13.
Adequate financial investment in vaccine surveillance is needed i.e.
Ebola is a killer disease caused by a virus.
Ebola virus is spread by contact with bats and monkeys and also by contact with a person infected by the Ebola virus.
"Ebola spreads quickly from person to person, kills in a short time BUT can be prevented."
Is an infected person contagious even if symptoms have A person infected with Ebola is not contagious before the symptoms appear.
The incubation period is 2 to 21 days.
What are the signs and symptoms of Ebola?
"High fever (brutal and prolonged) Joint or body pain (especially the chest) Nausea, vomiting (can be bloody) Dehydration (no tears, dry tongue, sunken eyes)."
It is important to note that a person is contagious only when they begin to have one or more signs of the disease.
"If a person infected by Ebola survives, is she/he No, before returning home, Ebola patients WILL have their blood tested in the laboratory to ensure that the virus is no longer in their body."
"However, people who have recovered from the illness should NOT have sex for at least three months unless they use Can Ebola be transmitted by saliva?"
"The Ebola Virus can be transmitted by saliva and other bodily skin, the eyes or the mouth of other people, they can get the Can Ebola be transmitted by sweat?"
"Yes, shaking hands with a person infected with Ebola transmits How should Igreet people, if the hand shake is not Hand shaking should be avoided as it is a risk during an Ebola outbreak or before a potential outbreak."
You can greet people by waving to them or acknowledge by shaking your head.
It is very important to wash your hands with soap and clean water What distance do Ineed to keep away from people suspected of having Ebola?
Avoid touching and handling objects that have been used by a person suspected of having Ebola.
Why should Inot eat bush-meat?
Wild animals are the source of the Ebola virus.
"If bush-meat is well cooked or smoked, is it safe to eat?"
"No, because during hunting, slaughtering and preparing bushmeat people are exposed to the Ebola Virus."
That is how transmission occurs and the reason why people should avoid touching or eating bush-meat.
"Do Ineed to avoid all bush-meat or just monkey and bat During an Ebola outbreak, avoid all bush-meat because it is very dangerous and can infect you with Ebola."
"There is no evidence linking Ebola and domestic animals such as chickens, goats and cows."
"It is only bush-meat that is Can Iget Ebola through contact with urine and droppings Yes, bats are carriers of the Ebola Virus."
You can get Ebola if you are in contact with urine and/or droppings of infected bats.
"During the rainy season, there are many bats and they feed on mangoes."
"No, you can continue eating mangoes but wash them before eating."
Do NOT eat mangoes that have been bitten by bats.
Where can Ibuy medicine to treat Ebola?
Your chances of survival and recovery are much higher if you seek Ihave heard that people are injected and killed at the health facility.
This is a false rumour.
Chances of survival are greater when one starts treatment early.
The medical team is working hard to save their patients and to have them returned to their families.
At the health facility the medical team treats Ebola by: And any other supportive treatment the patient may require.
"Is it true that a mix of ginger, honey, garlic, onion and No, it is not true."
There is no home remedy to treat Ebola.
You must go to the nearest health facility for proper management and treatment if you or someone you suspect has an Ebola infection.
Your chances for survival are far much higher at an Ebola treatment We have heard that drinking alcohol prevents Ebola virus transmission.
"No, it is not true."
"In fact, excessive consumption of alcohol is harmful to your body."
Is it true that Ebola is a curse?
"No, it is not true."
Ebola is a viral disease transmitted to humans from infected wild animals.
It can also be spread from an infected person to another person.
"No, you are endangering the lives of your loved ones, your own life and those of the community, because the disease can easily spread from one person to another."
What system has the Government put in place to screen Ebola and are able to identify any suspicious cases on arrival and What plans does the Government have to send information about Ebola to the rural population?
Communication materials such as posters and fact sheets have also been developed and Radio and SMS is also being used to reach rural communities.
"Currently, there is no plan for closing the borders or pose called upon to remain vigilant by practicing the set prevention behaviours and also to report to the nearest health facility any persons they suspect to have signs and symptoms of Ebola."

"They control the distribution of billions of dollars annually and play a significant role in shaping global discourse on the social and political priorities, norms, and solutions If our aspirations of equity are to be achieved, it is essential that these places of influence not only reflect the diversity of our global community, but actively seek to balance power structures."
"For those of us working in the global health space, it is imperative that our work is informed by the voices of people on the ground and addresses the needs of the communities at For the first time, Global Health 50/50s report finds parity among the chairs and members of the boards of nonprofit organisations."
"Yet are these women getting the support they need to be successful, or are they being impeded?"
These questions provide a possible theme for a further report.
"We also see the most diverse cohort of new leaders to date, a testament to the hard work within organisations to publish In this Report, Global Health 50/50 has undertaken an eye opening and critical examination of the governance landscape of global organisations active in health, which deeply resonates with me on a personal level and is both enlightening and sobering."
"Shockingly, only 2% of nonprofit board seats are held by women from low-income countries, while 17% are held by men from the USA."
The need to improve womens representation in boardrooms and across leadership teams cannot be overstated.
"Its not just about equality, it is also strategic."
"Diverse boards are better equipped to understand and respond to the needs of their stakeholders and the populations they aspire to serve, leading to improved corporate governance and As the first black woman to Chair the FIND Board of Directors Iam undoubtedly better equipped to serve the needs of populations in the Global South than my overrepresented counterparts from highincome countries."
Icant help but wonder if their response would have been different had those same decisions been made by a white man from a high-income country.
"It may be that for more women to step into leadership positions, the models and methodologies of leadership itself need to be reconsidered."
"So, Ido not want a seat at the Definitions of leadership can no longer be centred on traditionally masculine traits but must encompass compassion, empathy and the humanity of those whose lives are at stake."
"In her book, Feminism is for Everybody, bell hooks wrote, We should never leave it to women and equity-seeking leaders to carry the weight of gender-sensitive, equity-mindful, and diversity-unlocking decision-making alone."
"For transformative, sustained change which sees more women in leadership roles in global health and country-led health responses that address the rights and needs of girls and women requires courage and conviction - of women in leadership, those who support them and those working with them so that we might Through their thorough research and analysis, GH5050 continues to provide the impetus for us all to strive for greater equity and inclusion in global health governance."
"By championing women in all their diversity, we not only enhance organisational performance but also pave the way for a future where everyone has an equal Dixon-Fyle, S, et al."
"Ultimately, who benefits, and who is left behind?"
"In the past two years since we first investigated board representation, we find that boards have more women and more nationals from Gender equality is not just a lofty ideal; it is a fundamental human right and an essential precondition for achieving all the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the crucial areas of health and well-being."
"For the first time, gender parity has been reached among board chairs in the nonprofits, and the newest cohort of leaders is more diverse than ever before."
This is a clear indicator that change is not only possible but is already happening.
And we commend those organisations that have upped their game.
"However, American men still hold more global health board seats than women from all 57 low- and middle-income Additionally, the Report underscores that in decision-making spaces with greater female representation, women are more likely to ascend to leadership roles."
"Overtime we have documented the positive impact of these efforts, evidenced by policy changes and progress However, this progress is fragile and possibly at threat and future gains are far from assured."
"We are witnessing a wellfunded, organised backlash aiming to undermine the progress made in gender equality, womens rights, bodily autonomy, and gender diversity."
"It is vital that we consider any positive changes in policy and leadership in recent years, highlighted in this Report, with a long-term perspective and strive to ensure we do not see a step backwards Encouragingly, we are seeing a small but positive movement in terms of investment."
"An Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) analysis revealed that during , 62% of official development assistance was gender blind and only 4% was allocated to programmes in which gender equality and womens empowerment was the main objective."
"Feminist funding initiatives have sought to fill this gap, with a welcome focus on resourcing progressive women-led movements fighting for gender justice, especially in While we would like to see even greater investments, including from governments, equally importantly, accountability mechanisms must be prioritised alongside advocacy to ensure real, lasting change."
We have seen the power or at least the potential of accountability in initiatives such as The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in opposing the effects of discrimination around the world.
"We hope that the data in our report will provide young women, staff associations and other reformers with some of the evidence that will help them hold their organisations to account for greater diversity and equity in Achieving gender equality is not a secondary goal but a cornerstone of a sustainable and just future."
Most organisations in the sample are headquartered in high-income countries.
"This geographical locus of power heavily influences the composition of their In nonprofit organisations, most board seats are occupied by nationals from high-income countries, with only 5% held by nationals from low-income countries."
"Women from low-income countries hold just 2% of nonprofit board seats, while 17% of seats are held by men from the USA alone."
The proportion of women and nationals from low- and middle-income countries is even lower on the boards of for-profit companies in the sample.
The newest cohort of board chairs is more diverse than GH5050 first reported.
"For the first time, gender parity among board chairs in nonprofit organisations has been achieved, with 51% of board chairs being women, a significant change from 30% in 2018."
"This progress mirrors the rise in public commitments to gender equality, which have grown from 68% in 2018 to 91% in 2024 among nonprofits in our sample."
"Drawing on seven years of annual assessments, the Report finds that while some progress has been made, significant and alarming gaps remain, especially in diversity in leadership and pay equity."
This increase should be celebrated.
"However, gender parity has not been achieved in all sectors."
"Among for-profit companies, only 16% of board chairs are women."
"While low, this is a marked increase from 2% since 2018."
A closer look at power and pay reveals inequities even when gender parity has been achieved.
"An assessment of the nonprofits in the GH5050 sample that submit US tax returns shows that while more than half of CEOs are women, men lead organisations with average revenues more than twice as large as those led by women."
"As larger revenues are linked to larger salaries for CEOs, men CEOs earn on average $ more annually than their women counterparts."
"Gender pay inequalities are rampant driven by, for example, womens historically lower pay, the disproportionately low representation of women in senior roles, occupational segregation, and gender discrimination."
"In the UK, where gender pay gap reporting is mandatory, there has been some progress towards equality."
"The median gender pay gap, which measures pay gaps across an entire workforce, has decreased from 13.1% to 10.9% since 2017 among organisations in our sample."
"The underrepresentation of individuals from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially women, in decision-making roles is a stark reminder of the work still needed to achieve global health equity."
"Only through sustained and collective effort can we hope to dismantle the entrenched power structures that perpetuate inequities in global health Evagora-Campbell M, Kedia S, Odero HO, et al."
This is a subsample of the 201 organisations annually assessed by GH5050 and excludes organisations where board membership is mandated through member state participation or where data could not be located (pg 16).
"GH5050 also presents data on the gender pay gap reported by organisations in the sample with a presence in the UK, where employers with more than 250 staff are legally required to report their gender pay gap annually (pg 31)."
"Part 4 presents organisational performance in 2024, as well as progress since 2020 by category (consistently high performers; fast risers; Full details of the methods GH5050 employed to collect data on the core variables, and to calculate organisational performance can be found in the Annex."
Eleven global consultancy companies with an interest in the health sector are also included.
"One consultancy company was added to the sample this year, upon We present the findings separately in acknowledgement of the inherent differences in roles, interests and motivations between profit-generating companies with an interest in influencing health (including those with an interest in health policies at global and national levels), and organisations with core mandates to advance global health and wellbeing and social justice."

The GH5050 Report and Index continue to provide the singlemost comprehensive analysis on gender equality and the distribution of power and privilege in global health.
"These are highly heterogeneous organisations, each with their own unique purpose, system of governance and organisational arrangements."
What binds them is a stated interest in influencing health outcomes and/or global health policy.
"Five organisations were added in 2024 three of which are new incarnations of organisations previously in the sample, one a social enterprise company that requested to be included, and one a partner of GH5050 in the Global Food The 2024 sample comprises: The Global Health 50/50 Report and organisational sample"

"MEN CLAIM POWER, including at the very top Progress in representation mirrors increased gender equality commitments and policies Among 87 nonprofit organisations assessed since 2018, Public commitments to gender equality have risen from 68% in 2018 to 91% in 2024."

"Among 49 for-profit companies assessed since 2018, Public commitments to gender equality have risen from 33% in 2018 to 80% in 2024."
Availability of gender equality policies has risen
"As we watch her work, we are reminded of the entrepreneurial spirit of women across the world who find innovative ways to support their families and manage their households."
"Among the sample of 201 organisations which GH5050 annually assesses, this board review excluded organisations whose board compositions are determined by national governments (e.g., bilateral agencies) and/or member states (e.g., UN agencies)."
"An additional 19 organisations were excluded given that information on their board members was not publicly available, or the existence of a board could not be determined (see pg 6 Data collected on each board member includes the gender and nationality of board members, the current country of primary employment affiliation, and where the organisation they work for is headquartered."

"Nombulelo has always been fascinated by the anatomy of cars, and when the opportunity arose to work with her uncle, she saw it as a chance to learn and empower herself in the industry."
The starkest inequalities are found in the disproportionately low representation of women from low- and middle-income countries in the governance of organisations active in global health.
Organisations in the sample are primarily headquartered in high-income countries The location of an organisations on the board: organisations (nonprofit and for-profit) headquartered in LMICs are more likely to have nationals from LMICs on their boards than organisations in HICs (p<0.01).
"Average % of board members by nationality, by headquarter location of nonprofit organisations Organisations headquartered Organisations headquartered in low/middle-income (n=13) Most nonprofit board seats are held by nationals of high-income countries Women from low- and  middle-income countries are Proportion of women on nonprofit boards varies by incomelevel of the headquarter country and Indian nationals (who (20%) appear to be living and/or working in highincome countries by nationals of highincome countries of nonprofit board seats  30 of from low-income countries Board seats in high-income of nonprofit board seats are held by women from 57 low- and Board seats in middle-income are held by men from the USA Board seats in low-income Country income classification The World Bank assigns countries to four income groups  low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high  based on the gross national income per capita of the country."

Whether global health is really global is a question still searching for an affirmative answer.
Almost all global organisations in GH5050s sample (87% of nonprofit and 98% of for-profit) are headquartered in high-income countries.
Most of their board seats (65% of nonprofit and 89% of for-profit) are held by people from high-income countries.
"On for-profit boards, it is 30.1% for men from the United States, 0.2% for women from lowincome countries."
"With that much skew, our global initiatives are easily misdirected, ineffective, and counterproductive."
The problem is also a lack of solidarity.
"As normalised as it is, this status quo is indefensible."
"If, as this excellent GH5050 Report suggests, having targets has helped increase gender parity on senior management and boards, then Icall for global organisations to commit to a target for fair geographical representation."
The boards of the 99 nonprofit organisations assessed in 2022 and 2024 are less dominated by nationals of high-income countries than two years ago.
"While 85% of the global population lives in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), 34.5% of nonprofit boards seats and 11.6% of forprofit board seats are held by nationals of LMICs."
"Among 99 nonprofit organisations assessed in 2022 and 2024 Among 43 for-profit companies assessed in 2022 and 2024 One for-profit company in the sample is headquartered outside of high-income of for-profit organisations are headquartered in high-income countries Board inequalities differ by sector % Seats held by LIC women % Seats held by LIC women to reach geographic equity to reach geographic equity At the current pace of change, it will take: Geographic inequalities on boards"

The policy also has a target of no one gender comprising more than 70% of the Board.
"Among the 148 nonprofit organisations in the sample, data on the gender of board members was found for 124 organisations."

"Theyve been sleeping outside of the justice center in Portland, Oregon, where nightly protests have been held since the murder of George Floyd."
"Previously the two had slept at a shelter, but were kicked out for attending the protests for fear of COVID-19 infection."
CEOs and board chairs that are nationals of LMICs completed their their studies in the US or UK
"Among 70 new nonprofit leaders (CEOs and board chairs) appointed in 2023/2024, 43% were women , 46% were from LMICs, and 20% had completed their education in LMICs."
This cohort is more diverse in terms of gender and nationality than the sample of leaders as a whole  a trend we have seen since 2020.
"Among 87 nonprofit organisations, senior management bodies with 45%+ women women in senior management Women are least represented in the senior management of organisations with financial power  funders and for-profit companies."
"The disparity is particularly pronounced among the well-established, highest-funded nonprofits  the larger and more robustly funded nonprofits, the more likely it is run by a white man."
"Moreover, the fact that half of the CEOs in the sample were women should also remind us that gender parity does not by itself equate to power parity."
"With more women and women of color CEOs leading nonprofits in times of unprecedented organizational and landscape changes and risk, their success and surrounding support are critical."
"The Global Health 50/50 report enables renewed, constructive conversations with peers, allies, donors and volunteers to ensure that we look holistically at what is required and desired for equity and parity in the highest organisational ranks and define how we get there."
"To provide a snapshot of whether the gender of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is associated with rates of pay, Global Health 50/50 reviewed the tax returns filed by the nonprofit organisations in the sample (NGOs, faithbased organisations and public-private partnerships) and reported to the US Internal Revenue Service, which are public record."
Financial data for the years 2015 and 2021 (latest available) were collected for the 29 organisations for which records were found for both years.
"In 2021, more than half (55%; 16/29) of CEOs were women - an increase from when 11 (38%) nonprofits were headed by women."
The average salary for men was average salary for women ($).
"This represents a gap of 28% - an increase from 2015, when the salary gap between men and women was 18% ($ for men The average total revenue of organisations led by men was more than twice that of organisations led by women in 2021 ($389 million compared to $187 million)."
"The average difference in revenue of organisations led by women compared men fell from a ratio of 3:1 in 2015 to 2:1 While this remains a small sample and should be interpreted with caution, our findings are consistent with another finding in this Report that smaller organisations are more likely to have women board chairs than larger organisations (see pg 23)."
The findings also echo those from a larger study of nonprofits in the USA which found that white men were more likely to be leading larger and best funded organisations compared to women of colour.2 Our findings align with evidence from the US and the UK.
"Data from the UK, where gender pay gap reporting is mandatory (see next section), shows that the difference in pay increases among older populations and is largest among the highest earners.3 Women generally begin their careers closer to pay parity with men, but they lose ground as they age and progress through their work lives, due to a range of factors including parenthood and occupational segregation.3 Clerkin, C., Diomande, M., Koob, A. ."
"In the UK, reporting the gender pay gap has been mandatory since 2017 for organisations with more than 250 employees."
The law has driven transparency on the gender pay gap in the UK and provided valuable information to employers and employees on inequality inside their organisations.
"As we have previously reported, in the absence of mandatory reporting, exceedingly few organisations voluntarily publish their In the UK, discrimination and disparities faced by ethnic minority employees are well-documented and evidence has shown that the gender pay gap widens for certain ethnic groups.6 Despite calls for reporting of the ethnicity pay gap to be made mandatory, however, the UK Government has stated that it will remain voluntary for Even in the absence of legislative requirements, employers active in global health, who are often working to advance social justice and gender equality, should act as models for career equality, including by publicly reporting pay gap data."
"This data can inform target-setting and the development of policies to reduce the gap, such as including multiple women in shortlists for recruitment and promotion, and transparency in pay negotiations."
"In 2023, across 40 organisations, the median gender pay gap for hourly pay was 10.9% in mens favour (mean pay gap = 10.6%)."
The gap across the 40 organisations equates to women earning 89p for every Some progress was made in closing the gap  from 13.1% in 2017 to 10.9% in 2023 for median pay gap.
The median percentage of women and men receiving bonus pay was the same (93%).
"However, the median gender bonus pay gap was 16.4%, or 84p for women for every 1 paid to men (mean bonus pay gap = 21%)."
"Representation of women across the pay quartiles While more women were represented in higher pay quartiles than in 2017, the continued over-representation of women in lower pay quartiles and under-representation in top quartiles contributes to the persistence of gender pay gaps."
"As the sole earner in her family, her work is essential."

GH5050 has monitored nonprofit organisations since 2018 (61 nonprofit organisations have been added since 2018 and are not included in this trend analyses).
GH5050 has also monitored 49 for-profit companies since (4 have been added since and are not included in this trend analysis).
"GH5050 has monitored 145 nonprofit organisations and 52 for-profit Monitoring the gender-related policies of 148 Nonprofit Organisations and 53 For-Profit Companies active in global health Seven years of robust evidence summarised in the Gender and Health Index reveals where progress is being made and where it is not, and whether and how organisations are using the findings of the Index to drive change."
It is this that Iapplied as the inaugural chief officer for scientific workforce diversity at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - and delivered real impact in increasing the number of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in senior roles.
"Academic, scientific and health institutions are made stronger through the contributions of women and underrepresented groups  stronger through diversity in thought, priorities and the problems we aim to solve in global health, and, ultimately, in the solutions we bring in ensuring health equity for all."
Public commitments to gender equality have grown quickly over the past seven years.
"Among the 87 nonprofit organisations assessed since 2018, public commitments were found for 91% of organisations, up from 68% in 2018."
"The conceptualisation of gender as interacting with but different from sex and as a relational, contextual, and changing social construction that influences who holds power is foundational to understanding how gender influences both career pathways and health outcomes."
"Over seven years of exploring how organisations active in global health speak about and define gender, we have found a growing use of definitions of gender that align with global norms."
"Defining gender and its meaning Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed."
"As a social construct, gender varies from society to society and can change over time."
"Gender is the social roles, behaviours, activities, attributes, and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys; women and men; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex life populations."
"Gender has three components; gender identity, physical markers and gender expression."
Gender is about the roles of people of all diversities.
It is not only about women.
The roles that women have are fundamentally shaped by the roles that men have.
"Gender roles and relationships are based on beliefs and practices that can be transformed to create more balanced relationships, partnerships and resilience for everyone."
"For example, social ideas about masculinity can be harmful to men, who may be expected to behave in certain ways or take up activities that can affect their mental and We view patriarchy as creating and sustaining power inequalities by men collectively over women (including cis and trans women), as well as gendernonconforming individuals, and by some groups of men over other marginalized men, and as a social force that keeps all individuals from having the connected, fulfilled, and peaceful lives they deserve."
"Gender analysis has increasingly revealed how womens subordination is socially constructed, and therefore able to change, as opposed to being biologically predetermined and Clarity around the concept of gender should be considered as foundational to gender analysis and gender assessments of career structures, health policies and programmes."
"Given that advancing health and social justice is not the purpose of most of the for-profit companies in our sample, we would not necessarily expect them to provide public definitions of gender  and find that they largely do not."
"Member of the GH5050 Advisory Council Gender is a lens to view power and, with that lens, to make systems of power more just."
"Although the world is widely off track to meet its gender equality goals, GH5050 finds welcome progress among the 201 organisations included in its report, including that more organisations have EDI policies."
We see that the location of organisations (HICs vs LMICs) is strongly associated with the make-up of the leadership.
Organisations in HICs tend to have a majority of board members from HICs and organisations in LMICs have a majority of board members from LMICs.
At the same time HIC organisations have a higher proportion of female board membership.
"Furthermore, while the shares of CEOs and board chairs that are men and nationals from HICs have decreased since 2020, almost 9 out of 10 CEOS and board chairs were educated in high-income countries in 2024."
"This raises important questions about what is valued in leadership and which global perspectives dominate, while also pointing to the need to strengthen tertiary education in LMICs."
"Ultimately, this data reminds us that where agendas, knowledge and capital are produced dictates power and privilege."
"While the Report has highlighted some positive trends, now is not the time for complacency."
"These statements alone are not sufficient, and at the same time definitions of excellence are not bias free and access to elite institutions is not equal."
There is growing intolerance and constant pushback on the struggle for social justice.
"Womens rights, LGBTQI, disability and indigenous groups have enriched the gender justice movement and driven progress, including for bodily autonomy."
"However, our differences have become divisive, fragmenting our social justice agenda."
"These divisions are further sown by anti-gender justice actors who endeavor to maintain systems of patriarchy, racism, colonialism, and religious fundamentalism, colluding with State and other actors to maintain power in the few hands who have long How can we withstand this rising tide of regressive and anti-gender justice forces?"
"Ibelieve that now more than ever, feminist leadership is needed."
"Feminist leadership is about sharing power to build inclusive, just and caring organisations and systems."
"We need to have honest conversations within the movement, link across different sectors, and reframe the narrative around what is possible when we work in solidarity rather than in opposition."
GH5050  and the data found in these pages  is a crucial part of the work.
There is too much at stake to stop now.
"Note: This brief opinion piece is shaped by the privilege of engaging with feminist activists from around the world, each working to make our socio-economic systems more just and caring."
"Legal frameworks exist to protect workers against discrimination, yet this is not enough to counteract the individual bias and structural discrimination that disadvantage people on the basis of gender identity or sex."
Organisational governance is concerned with how power and control over resources and decision-making are distributed among various actors through formal structures and processes.
"Governing boards represent the locus of power in organisations where decisions on leadership, strategy, finance, and programming are made that influence the career opportunities and health outcomes of people around the world."
"GH5050 explored how many organisations have board diversity policies in the public domain, and which of those have specific measures, such as targets, to make and monitor progress."
Have boards composed of representatives nominated by member states (and hence representation is outside the hands of the organisations themselves) Board diversity policies among
"With growing public recognition of the importance of gender equality in governance spaces, as a matter of fairness and as a contribution to improved decision-making, corporate performance and financial outcomes, demands on governments to take action to ensure women are fairly represented on boards Several countries have implemented regulations and initiatives to increase gender diversity on corporate boards."
"In India, the Companies Act, 2013, mandates that publicly listed companies have at least one woman on their board."
"Malaysia has a target of 30% women in decision-making positions in the corporate sector, supported by the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance."
"In Kenya, the Constitution and Mwongozo Code require that no more than two-thirds of state board members be Using data on the representation of women on the boards of the largest stock-listed companies in the European Union (EU), studies have shown that EU countries in which board quotas have been introduced have a higher share of women on boards than countries without quotas.1 Studies in the United States, Australia and Germany have also identified a trickle-down effect where companies with women on their boards tend to have more women in CEO, top executive, and managerial positions."
"Findings on this relationship are not universal: studies in Norway and Italy, for example, did not find clear evidence of a trickle-down effect following the introduction of gender quotas for corporate boards."
The authors of these studies suggest that it may take time for the effects of board gender quotas on womens career advancement to become apparent.
"Once a nurse in London, her passion for caring was overshadowed by experiences of racism and discrimination, prompting her return home."

An organisations performance is calculated using a point system across eight variables.
Gender of CEO and Board Chair is not scored.
Organisations with 10 or fewer staff are not expected to have workplace gender equality or diversity policies and are not scored on these variables.
Organisational pages can be found at: Consistently strong; organisation has scored at least points each year since 2021.
Organisation validated the data published in the Fast riser; organisation has increased their score by 3 or more points since 2021.
Moderate riser; organisation has increased their score by 2 points since 2021.
No progress since 2021; organisation has not scored above 1 and has not increased their score by more than 1 point since 2021 or organisations score has decreased by 3 or more points since 2020.
"No woman leader; organisation has not had a woman CEO or Board Chair since 2018 (among organisations assessed since 2018, n=135)."
These organisations have transparent policies and measures in place to advance gender equality and are at or near gender parity in their decision-making bodies.
"They are also often the most likely to engage with GH5050 during the data validation process, which may be further indication of their interest in and support for transparency and public accountability."
"Another subset of 67 organisations has demonstrated increasing commitment to set and strengthen gender-responsive policies, where GH5050 had previously reported them lacking or unavailable."
"Over the period 2021-24, these organisations have improved their overall score, and most have engaged regularly with GH5050 and actively responded to the findings of the Gender and Health Index."
"By contrast, we find that the scores of 59 organisations have been consistently low and little to no progress has been made."
"Only a few of these organisations have engaged with GH5050, including to validate and contribute to the findings reported in the Index, which may also be an indication of the relatively lower level of interest and resources invested in gender, diversity and inclusion measures by the Another 22 organisations have performed variably over the past four years and not improved their performance by more than one point since 2021."

The sample includes organisations actively involved in global health and those organisations that aim to influence global health policy even if this is not their core function.
"Rather, organisations under review have been identified as having demonstrated an interest in influencing global health and/or global Between 2018 and 2020, the sample shifted in its composition to account for 1) the thematic focus of the Report each year, 2) continued efforts to identify global organisations headquartered in low- and middle-income countries, and 3) the general evolution of the global health presented for  public commitment to gender equality,  definition of gender and  policy on gender equality in the workplace."
GH5050 has monitored 87 nonprofit organisations since 2018 (61 nonprofit organisations have been added since 2018 and are not included in this trend analyses).
"GH5050 has also monitored 49 for-profit companies since 2020 (4 have been added since and are not included in presented for  policy on diversity and inclusion in the workplace and  policy on board diversity and inclusion, as GH5050 introduced these variables in 2020."
GH5050 has monitored 145 nonprofit organisations and 52 for-profit companies since 2020.
Ten sectors are represented 1.
"Private sector for-profit companies: Corporate participants in the Business and Health Action Group of the Global Business Council that provided a platform for the engagement of To measure concepts as contextual as diversity and equality with a standardised, simple methodology may seem a fools errand."
We recognise what has been called the violence committed to nuanced concepts such as intersectionality when we attempt to reduce them to measurable indicators.
"Nonetheless, we are all aware that what gets measured, gets done."
"We have sought to establish clear rationale for the categorisation of each organisation, at times directly with the organisation."
GH5050 has developed a rigorous methodology that is consistent with established systematic review research methods.
"Data are coded according to content, using a traffic light system established in advance of data collection and refined Most data collected and analysed comes from publicly available websites."
Transparency and accountability are closely related and by relying on publicly available data we aim to hold organisations and stakeholders to account - including for having genderrelated policies accessible to the public.
This decision is also drawn from our concern that some people may not get as far as the job ads if they dont see any commitment to equality in the main pages of the Some organisations follow the workplace policies of host organisations or parent companies.
"For the corporate alliances and federations, we looked for evidence of policies that were normatively gender equality-promoting."
"We did not accept evidence from members alone (e.g., IFBA has membership including Coca-Cola; we did not accept evidence of genderresponsive programmes from Coca-Cola We used an earlier version of this methodology to review a small number of global health organisations and global PPPs in health."
"These reviews were Pfizer, GSK, UN Foundation, & GBC Health and the Global Health Council."
Data was collected from online public sources  primarily from biographies on the organisations board page and Linked.
"Among the sample of 201 organisations which GH5050 annually assesses, this board review excluded organisations whose board compositions are determined by national governments (e.g., bilateral agencies) and/or member states (e.g., UN agencies)."
"Data collected on each board member includes the gender and nationality of board members, their place of employment, and where the organisation they work for is headquartered."
Data was drawn primarily from individuals online biosketches and Linked.
Discrepancies were discussed with a third reviewer until consensus was reached on the final entry.
Board membership demographic data is not validated with organisations.
"In that correspondence, we request the nomination and contact details of a focal point in the organisation who can review and validate the data once collected."
"Following completion of data collection, we send each organisation their preliminary results and ask them to review and provide any additional information, documentation or policies to review."
Results are shared with all organisations before publication.
The status of an organisation as nonprofit or for-profit and whether an organisation is headquartered in an LMIC were binary variables.
"Percentages of women on senior management teams, women on governing boards, and LMIC nationalities on governing boards were continuous variables."
"Organization size was recoded as follows: 1 to 49 employees as 1, Following that, we conducted regression analyses to examine relationships between variables."
"Linear regression was used where the outcome was continuous (e.g., percentage of women on boards), and logistic regression was used where the outcome was binary (e.g., gender equality workplace policy with specific measures)."
Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were conducted.
"For instance, to examine whether being nonprofit was correlated with a higher percentage of women on governing boards, we controlled for the percentage of women on senior management teams, gender of CEO and board chair, percentage of LMIC nationalities on governing boards and organisation size."
"The strengths of correlations were noted, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant."
"Statistically significant results are indicated in the report, with correlation strengths for US-based organisations US-based nonprofits are required to report their tax records to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) every year."
"Where data was unavailable on IRS (due to delays in processing tax records), we used data from Pro."
"Then, we analysed differences in CEO pay by gender and the revenue size of organisations led Organisations with 250 employees in the UK are legally required to report their gender pay gap data to the UK government every year, while smaller organisations can opt into voluntary reporting."
"For organisations in our sampling frame that have a presence in the UK, we extracted their gender pay gap data from 2017 to 2023 from the UK Gender Pay Gap Service website, including mean and median percentage differences in hourly rate pay and bonus pay, percentages of women in different pay quartiles and percentages of women receiving bonus pay."
"The methods described above were approved by the ethics committee of Strengths and limitations As far as we know, this is the only systematic attempt to assess how gender is understood and practised by organisations working in and/or influencing the field of global health across multiple dimensions (commitment, workplace policy content, gender and geography of leadership and genderresponsive programming)."
"While our efforts may have omitted relevant measures and do not include all active organisations, this method provides the opportunity to measure status quo and report on organisations progress."
This method has allowed us to shine a light on the state of gender equality in global health and organisations across all sectors have begun to respond to our call.
We believe that the collection of data and information for measurement and accountability is a fundamental first step to GH5050 has developed a rigorous methodology that is consistent with established systematic review research methods.
"Organisations are invited to contribute to and validate data collected on their policies and practices at least twice during the data collection Organisational performance for 2024 is categorised into five quintiles: very high performer, high performer, moderate performer, low performer, and very low performer."
"The variables that are included Public commitment to gender equality Public definition of gender Workplace gender equality policy Workplace diversity and inclusion policy Board diversity and inclusion policy Gender parity in senior management Gender parity in governing body Policy on reporting of sexdisaggregated programmatic data We also present trends in organisational performance on the above variables over four years, which are categorised as: consistently high performers, fast risers, moderate risers, uneven performers and stagnators."
"Trend scores are based on organisations scores in 2021, 2022, 2023, For each variable, organisations are scored 1, 0 or -1 points, meaning that the highest possible score is 8 points, while the lowest possible score is -8 points."
"Governing Bodies (Pindicates that more than 55% women are represented) Member State (MS) for the board policy variable, indicating that the governing body consists of Member States and that no other board diversity policy is Not Found (NF) for gender parity in senior management and governing body variables, indicating that the existence of these bodies could not be verified and/or no information on board Minus one (-1) point for: Each not found (NF) for Workplace gender equality policy, Workplace diversity and inclusion policy and Board diversity and inclusion policy (i.e., policies could not be located on public For organisations that receive scores of Not Applicable (NA), the total number of available points is reduced to avoid unfairly penalising these organisations."
"NAs are applied in the following cases: Organisations with 10 or fewer staff receive an NA for Workplace gender equality policy and Workplace diversity and inclusion policy, unless they are subject to the policies of a larger host Organisations that have informed GH5050 that they do not have a governing body receive an NA for Board diversity and inclusion policy and Gender parity in governing body."
Organisations that do not report programmatic data receive an NA for Reporting of sex-disaggregated We have not assigned a score based on the gender of the CEO or Board Chair as we have not agreed on a methodology that is fair and defensible.

"Globally, programmes to fight neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are making significant progress."
"Fifty countries have eliminated at least one NTD, halfway towards the elimination target of 100 countries by 2030."
Much of this success is thanks to the concerted efforts of health workers and volunteers committed to alleviating and preventing the suffering of some of the worlds most marginalized populations.
"At the same time, climate change, population displacement, an uncertain funding landscape and other factors have the potential to increase the spread of many NTDs beyond their traditional breeding grounds in lowincome countries and tropical zones."
"This only increases the need for cross-sectoral interventions to improve water, sanitation and hygiene; vector control; and One Health approaches to human, animal and environmental management; along with individual case management and preventive chemotherapy."
"While we have many effective tools, we must also acknowledge the need for new and cost-effective strategic approaches for NTDs."
"Further research is needed for the development of diagnostics, drugs, vaccines, antivenoms and morbidity management strategies."
"There is a concurrent need to strengthen data collection and surveillance mechanisms, to enhance the evidence base and to improve the global capacity to deliver high-quality interventions for NTDs."
"Many countries are now taking over domestic NTD programmes and initiatives, which can help empower affected communities to play an active role in their own health."
"Although gaps remain, we have the know-how and the momentum to support countries to break generational cycles of disease and poverty and give their populations one of the greatest gifts  the elimination of diseases."
"Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 This 2024 global report was prepared under the overall guidance of Ibrahima Soc Fall (Director, WHO Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Programme [WHO/NTD]) with the support of the entire staff of WHO/NTD."

Data on progress begin to provide insights into the prospects of attaining the 2030 targets.
"Despite these challenges, significant milestones have been reached."
"In 2023, five countries were acknowledged by WHO for eliminating one NTD, and one country for eliminating two NTDs."
"As of , a total of 50 countries have successfully eliminated at least one NTD, marking the halfway point towards the 2030 target of 100 countries."
"This achievement is commendable and highlights opportunities for further progress against the 13 NTDs targeted for eradication, elimination and elimination as a public health problem."
"Health services have not yet fully recovered from the disruptions caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of people treated through preventive chemotherapy in 2022 (49 million fewer than in 2021, also confirmed by the slight drop of the integrated treatment coverage index, 46%), while access to water supply, sanitation and hygiene is overall 85.8% in NTDendemic countries and 63% among the population requiring interventions against NTDs."
The share of the population at risk protected against catastrophic out-ofpocket health expenditure due to NTDs is 87.4%.
A total of 48 technical products and operational tools of global relevance were published by WHO in 2023.
"Regarding integration, the global skin NTD community has notably gained momentum, as symbolized by the first global meeting at WHO made towards expanding the preventive chemotherapy approach to control of Taenia solium taeniasis."
"In 2023, cross-sectoral coordination has been extended to address more NTDs."
"The collaboration between the WHO Global NTD Programme and the WHO Health Emergencies Programme is being strengthened, notably in the areas of outbreak-prone NTDs and dracunculiasis eradication, and, in general, for the maintenance of NTD essential services in the context of health emergencies."
Two specific issues have been identified for facilitating the inclusion of NTDs within national health systems: positioning NTDs within universal health coverage and mainstreaming NTDs data into the national health information system.
"At the global level, this effort is reflected in having the NTD community actively participate in high-level discussions on primary health care and universal health coverage, as well as in ensuring that NTDs are part of WHOs corporate effort to strengthen routine health information systems, with the aim of facilitating the roll-out of data collection platforms and tools to enable a consistent flow and use of information on all indicators for each NTD."
"Fostering sustained country ownership remains a challenge, particularly where resources are limited and competition with other health priorities is fierce."
"While progress has been slower than anticipated, there is optimistic confidence in bridging the gap and returning to the planned trajectory towards 2030."
Successes in the global fight against NTDs are being achieved in spite of persisting and new challenges.
The health community has shown great commitment and teamwork in tackling NTDs.
"We at WHO are proud to lead the global NTD agenda and support governments, partners and communities in their efforts."
"Together, we can make NTDs a thing of the past."
"Fighting NTDs is intrinsically linked to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ranging from poverty eradication to health improvement, education, gender equality, reduced inequalities, and partnerships ."
"The report presents epidemiological and programmatic data for 2022, which were gathered, compiled and analysed in 2023."
"In some cases, 2023 data are available and presented; in other cases, less recent information is included, when 2022 data are not available."
"The conclusions of the report and way forward are further complemented by annexes on cross-cutting indicator (Annex 1), status of donated medicines for treatment of NTDs (Annex 2), articles on NTDs in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (Annex 3) and target product profiles (TPPs) published as of 31 (Annex 4), and the list of global NTD reports published by WHO so far (Annex 5)."

"NTDs must be firmly repositioned within the global health architecture, given that interventions against these diseases can contribute to a wide range of ancillary benefits to other programmes within and beyond the health sector."
The global health community has vast experience and several strengths that should be leveraged to improve the design and efficiencies in implementation of interventions combating NTDs.
"Status of the global NTD response NTDs have complex epidemiologies with diverse life cycles that typically involve the environment, vectors, zoonotic reservoirs, and intermediate This makes control and measurement of progress towards established programme goals challenging."
Tracking progress is generally linked to disease-specific interventions for which a significant amount of data are regularly reported for most NTDs.
Metadata for this indicator are available in the SDG Indicators metadata repository .
"The main drivers of reduction in the number of people requiring interventions are the progressive attainment of end-point programmatic targets (interruption of transmission, elimination as a public health problem) by countries, the achievement of post-intervention surveillance status, and the reclassification of endemic areas from requiring to not requiring interventions because of improvement of epidemiological conditions or access to water and sanitation."
"The highest proportion was in the South-East Asia Region (51.4%), followed by the African (35.8%), Eastern Mediterranean (4.6%), Western Pacific (4.6%), Americas (3.2%) and European (0.4%) regions."
"This was approximately 26% less than the 2.19 billion people requiring interventions in 2010, and about 33million people fewer than reported in 2021."
The current reduction trend is insufficient to meet the indicator target by 2030 (Fig.

"However, 50% of the acknowledgement processes successfully completed over the past 5 years () have occurred in countries that had already eliminated an NTD, thus not contributing to this indicator."
Tracking the number of acknowledgment processes that have been successfully completed enables a better appreciation of progress towards elimination of NTDs.
"However, to achieve this indicator, missing criteria and acknowledgement processes for all diseases targeted for eradication, elimination and elimination as a public health problem need to be established; and NTD-endemic countries that have not yet completed any acknowledgment process should be encouraged to scale up interventions against NTDs and compile evidence demonstrating the attainment of the set target, as relevant."
"Currently, WHO has established acknowledgement processes for dracunculiasis, human African trypanosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, rabies, trachoma and visceral leishmaniasis; India was certified free of yaws through an ad-hoc process, after which guidance on procedures and criteria has been published ; guidance has also been recently published with regard to leprosy ."

"Information used to report against the cross-cutting indicators relates to 2022 and 2023, and was largely collected through the GNARF except for indicators 2, 4 and 6."
"The GNARF was introduced to Member States in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific and European regions."
"A total of 60 countries submitted the GNARF and the data were compiled in the NTD global database (NTD SMART): this database was used to report on cross-cutting indicators 1, 3, 5 and 710."
"Of the 60countries, 47 reported to be endemic for at least one NTD, 44 reported to have skin NTDs and 46 reported to have NTD-related disabilities."
"Zero deaths from chikungunya Cross-cutting indicator 2: Integrated treatment coverage index for preventive The integrated treatment coverage index for preventive chemotherapy is the geometric mean of the reported coverage rates achieved by programmes directed against the five main NTDs amenable to preventive chemotherapy: lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma."
The geometric mean is used deliberately to emphasize equity and promote integrated delivery across diseases.
"In the context of leaving no one behind, high coverage for one disease does not compensate for low coverage for another disease, even if the population requiring interventions is small."
"The global index was 63% in 2019, 31countries achieved 75% integrated coverage index for preventive chemotherapy, the target set for (Fig.2.4)."
Information used to report against this indicator was collected through the JAP; details of the methodology used can be found in a dedicated issue of the Weekly Epidemiological Record .
"Cross-cutting indicator 3: Number of countries that adopt and implement integrated skin neglected tropical disease strategies, 2022 Of the 44 countries that reported to have skin NTDs, were endemic for at least 2 or more of them; 18/35 countries responded on this indicator and 11 reported that they had adopted and were implementing integrated skin NTD strategies, as of 2022."
"In the context of the skin NTDs, integration is defined as the implementation of two or more programme activities simultaneously at community and health facility levels."
"Activities are diverse and include social mobilization, case-finding, disease management, capacity building, etc."
"The following conditions are considered skin NTDs: Buruli ulcer; cutaneous leishmaniasis; leprosy (Hansens disease); lymphatic filariasis; mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses; onchocerciasis; post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis; scabies and other ectoparasitoses; and yaws."

"Given the difficulty of defining areas endemic for neglected tropical diseases, different interpretations of this indicator have been applied."
"As of 2022, 85.8% of the global population living in the 118countries endemic for NTDs for which data are available have access to at least basic water supply and sanitation and basic hygiene (this percentage decreases to 80.8% if we only consider the population living in rural settings in the same countries)."
"Globally in 2022, 78.9% of the population were using at least basic sanitation, 90.2% were using at least basic water supply and 82.2% have handwashing facilities, including soap and water."
"Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 Cross-cutting indicator 5: Share of countries with neglected tropical diseases integrated in national health strategies/plans, 2022 Out of the 43 countries that responded to questions on the integration of NTDs into national health strategies/ plans through the GNARF, 28 (65.1%) met the criteria that at least 75% of relevant endemic NTDs are integrated into their national health strategies/plans."
"Countries with percentage of prevalent NTDs integrated in national health strategies/plans, 2022 Cross-cutting indicator 6: Share of the population at risk protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure due to neglected tropical diseases, 2021 Preliminary calculations based on a number of assumptions indicate that the global share of the population at risk of NTDs encountering catastrophic health spending was 12.6% in 2021."
"Consequently, the population at risk of NTDs protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure was 87.4%."
"However, the Eastern Mediterranean Region and the South-East Asia Region show higher financing risk Information used to report against this indicator was extracted from the WHO Global Health Observatory ()."

"Countries with percentage of prevalent NTDs having collected and reported data disaggregated by Number of people treated for neglected tropical diseases In 2022, approximately 848 million people received treatment for at least one NTD through preventive chemotherapy interventions, achieving a global coverage of 51% across 71 countries, a minor decrease from 53% in 2021, across 69 countries, when a total of 897 million were treated (Fig."
"Although the decrease in the number of people treated also reflects the scale-down of programmes when epidemiological targets are met, the main reason for the decrease observed between 2022 and 2023 is that India, the highest burden country requiring preventive chemotherapy, in 2022 covered about 117 million fewer people for lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis than in 2021 ."
"Excluding India, the number of people who received treatment for at least one disease increased by almost 60 million globally, from 402.3 million in 2021 to 462.2 million in 2022, confirming that the recovery after the disruptions caused by COVID-19 is progressing overall, although exceptions remain."
"In total, 1.47 billion treatments were delivered to individuals in 2022, indicating that a significant proportion of people were targeted for more than one NTD ."
Number of people receiving interventions against NTDs through preventive Number of people receiving interventions against NTDs diseases requiring individual management; it is assumed that most cases are also treated.
A general increase can be observed as a result of improved active and passive case-finding after COVID-19.
"Dengue data are largely driven by outbreaks and fluctuate over time, although the disease is now endemic in over 100 countries."
Rabies data show the number of deaths but are largely incomplete.
Only fragmentary data on other NTDs are reported to WHO.
"Global report on neglected tropical diseases 20242.1.4 Disease-specific global indicators, milestones and targets for 2030 Diseases targeted for eradication In 2023, a total of 14 human cases of dracunculiasis and 886 infections in animals (of which 784 in dogs) were reported globally."
"As of , only five countries are still considered endemic (Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan)."
Sudan has been reporting zerocases for several years but remains to be certified.
"The Democratic Republic of the Congo was certified as free of transmission in , bringing the total number of certified countries to 188."
"Main challenges to eradication include: insecurity in countries with ongoing transmission, notably Mali and South Sudan, and in Sudan, which is in the precertification stage; infections in humans and/or in animals (mostly dogs) are being reported in Cameroon and in the Central African Republic due to cross-border movement of populations, notably from Chad."
"This highlights the risk of reintroduction of transmission in certified countries sharing borders with endemic countries, and the need for sustained and adequate post-certification surveillance until global eradication The number of cases of dracunculiasis reported to WHO since 2010 and the certification status by country are shown in Fig."
"In the African Region, over the past years, Cameroon, Central African Republic and Congo have been implementing mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin at regular intervals."
"East Asia Region, Timor-Leste is planning to conduct surveys to demonstrate interruption of transmission, while Indonesia is scaling up surveillance activities."
"In the Western Pacific Region, Papua New Guinea, the most affected country, is planning to scale up access to diagnostic testing to confirm which are still the majority; the Philippines, Solomon Islands, Malaysia (where cases have recently been reported) and Vanuatu are strengthening surveillance the last country has also been conducting MDA."
"In the Region of the Americas, all countries are considered as previously endemic or with no previous history of yaws."
"Nevertheless, investigations are required to confirm the current status of transmission in some of the countries in the first group, in response to recent rumours of cases."
"As of , 82countries are considered as previously endemic; among these, several are compiling information to initiate the certification process."
WHO is currently in the process of establishing a joint commission to oversee certification processes for both dracunculiasis and yaws.
The number of cases of yaws reported to WHO since and the status of yaws endemicity are shown in Fig.

"Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 Surveillance and control activities for Chagas disease have gradually returned to pre-pandemic levels everywhere, with special significance in Latin America, where the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most severe globally, and where the peak of the last wave of SARS-Co. V-2 was registered in ."
It should also be noted that Chagas disease has increasingly become a relevant public health problem beyond the continental Latin American countries where vectorial transmission has long been documented.
"In this regard, as of , 44 countries have detected Chagas disease cases in the African, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, European and Western Pacific regions, all of which have been provided with technical support and antiparasitic medicines."
"Technical support on vectorial surveillance and control has also been provided to an additional group of countries with house infestation of triatomine bugs, including China, India, the Philippines, Viet Nam and the French overseas Various networks in support of public health control of Chagas disease are currently active: these gather sentinel laboratories involved in diagnostic activities, centres working on vectorial surveillance, and scientists dedicated to HIV/AIDST."

Ten Latin American countries have been verified for interruption of domiciliary vector transmission in the whole national territory or a portion of it.
"An additional group of countries have interrupted vectorial transmission by the principal triatomine bug, in the whole national territory or in a portion of it."
"As of , a total of 27 countries in the Americas, European and Western Pacific regions are fully implementing universal screening of blood and blood products, and are ready to request verification, once the Several countries are regularly screening both organ donors and receivers and no new cases of infection have been reported to WHO for the past 3 years."
"These countries are ready to request verification, once the Interventions for elimination of transmission of congenital Chagas disease have been initiated in different countries in the Americas and in Europe, with the screening and antiparasitic treatment of girls and women of childbearing age with T. cruzi infection, or screening of pregnant women and antiparasitic treatment of newborns and siblings."
"The region of Murcia, a first administrative division of Spain, is the first territory to claim to have achieved sustained interruption of congenital transmission over the past 7 years."
"Status of the global NTD response Human African trypanosomiasis (rhodesiense) The decreasing trend in transmission of rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis observed since the early 2000s is continuing; in 2022, only 38 cases were reported (equivalent to a 94% reduction between 2000 and 2022)."
"In 2022, Rwanda was validated by WHO as the first country to achieve elimination of rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis as a public health problem."
The geographical area at moderate or higher risk of rhodesiense HAT (reporting  1 case per people per year) was 14913 km2 in the period .

HAT case per 10000 people per year (average of 5 years) In 2022, the number of reported cases of visceral leishmaniasis was 13081 (13012 autochthonous and imported cases)."
"As of , 80 countries are considered endemic for In the South-East Asia Region, 99% (772 out of 775) of implementation units have achieved the epidemiological threshold of elimination as a public health problem."
"Out of the total reported cases of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), the proportion of cases detected and treated in the Region was 96% in 2021 and 87% in 2022."
"In 2022, the case-fatality rate among all types of visceral leishmaniasis cases (primary, relapse, HIV-coinfected) was still 1% in 16 of the 80 countries that reported at least one death."
"As of , only one country, Bangladesh (in the South-East Asia Region) has been validated by WHO for eliminating visceral leishmaniasis as a public Criteria and processes for validation of elimination of visceral leishmaniasis as a public health problem outside the South-East Asia Region are expected to be established by the end of 2024."
It is foreseen that the first countries could start the validation process in early 2025; several health ministries have already contacted WHO to request undergoing the validation process.
"The number of cases of visceral leishmaniasis reported to WHO since 2020, by Region, is shown in Fig."
"In 2022, 325.7 million people were treated, 39.2 million fewer than in 2021, reflecting the persistent disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic."
The number of countries implementing post-MDA surveillance was 10 in 2022.
"The projections were based on an optimistic assumption that triple-therapy MDA with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole (IDA) would be introduced in all areas where warranted by 2020 and transmission assessment surveys (TAS) would be implemented in all evaluation units when eligible."
"With some exceptions, COVID-19 delayed or disrupted MDA and TAS implementation for a 2-year period taking countries off-track from The number of people requiring treatment for lymphatic filariasis, the number of people treated and the corresponding coverage in are shown in Fig."
"Status of the global NTD response Rabies is still largely under-reported, mis- and underdiagnosed."
"As a result, data on mortality, access to vaccines and immunoglobulins, and occurrence in animal populations are limited, as is information on programmatic interventions such as mass dog vaccination."
"In general, surveillance for rabies is weak at country level, and misattribution of the cause of death is frequent."
"Currently, 71 countries are classified as endemic for human rabies, indicating that dog rabies and dog-transmitted human rabies are present in the country; however, only 24 of these countries have reported data for 2021; 17 reported data for 2022."
"Seven countries have sporadic occurrence of dog-transmitted human rabies, nine countries have widespread occurrence of dog rabies but no dog-transmitted human cases, and seven countries have limited occurrence of dog rabies and no cases of dog-transmitted human rabies."
"Finally, 82 countries are classified as having zero dog rabies and zero dog-transmitted human rabies cases."
"As of , Mexico is the only country validated for elimination of rabies as a public health problem, defined as the absence of a human death from dog-mediated rabies for at least 24 months in a country that is operating and continues to maintain adequate surveillance for rabies and demonstrates an effective rabies control programme in human and The number of human rabies deaths reported to WHO since 2020, by Region, is shown in Fig."
"This increase is mainly due to population growth in endemic areas, the limited number of impact assessment surveys conducted, the delay in changing treatment strategy after surveys, and the persistent use of district level as implementation unit (rather than lower administrative jurisdictions)."
"In this regard, WHO is currently undertaking a global review of the number of people requiring preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis at community level, as recommended in the guideline on control and elimination of human schistosomiasis ."
"Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 In 2022, 89.1 million people received treatment for schistosomiasis, that is, 8.4 million more than in 2021 (80.7 million) and 11.8 million more than in 2020 (77.3million), thus confirming a positive recovery trend after COVID-19 disruptions."
"As of , formerly endemic countries, areas and territories have been reporting zero autochthonous cases for several years in a row and claim to have interrupted transmission of Schistosoma spp."

"In addition, 108 million adolescent girls and 138.8 million pregnant and lactating women were estimated to require this intervention."
"In 2022, 492.6 million children who required preventive chemotherapy were treated for soil-transmitted helminth infections (101.8 million pre-SAC and 390.8 million SAC)."
"Coverage of pre-SAC and SAC was 38.4% and 61.8%, respectively."
"In addition, 89.1 million women of reproductive age were treated with albendazole through lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes."
"As of , five countries have been classified as no longer requiring preventive chemotherapy and have stopped this intervention: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Sudan and Niger; the decision was based on the reduced national prevalence of soil-transmitted helminthiases to below 2% derived from impact assessment surveys."
"A large number of countries has also been progressively removed from the list of those requiring preventive chemotherapy following the analysis of data on access to improved sanitation, based on a formal process agreed by WHO ."
"WHO is in the process of establishing the validation processes for countries that wish to be acknowledged for elimination of soil-transmitted helminthiases as a public health problem: as such no countries have yet With regard to strongyloidiasis, among the 107 estimated endemic countries, 51 have been implementing MDA with ivermectin for lymphatic filariasis and/or onchocerciasis for several years."
"However, since information on geographical distribution of strongyloidiasis within such countries is not available, it is not possible to ascertain if all endemic areas are being treated."

"As of , countries with transmission of chikungunya virus have Based on the information received from the health ministries, seven countries (Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Gabon, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines and Sudan) reported being endemic for chikungunya; and six countries (Ethiopia, French Polynesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Senegal and Singapore) reported sporadic presence of chikungunya."
"Of the countries where transmission is ongoing, sporadically present or suspected to occur, five countries (French Polynesia, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Singapore and Yemen) reported to be either partially mapped or having completed mapping for chikungunya."
"In 2022, zero deaths related to chikungunya were reported."
"In the same year, 3613 suspected cases were reported, of which 2028 were confirmed."

"In Cambodia, both opisthorchiasis and T. solium taeniasis are targeted by such exercise."
In Bolivia (Plurinational State of) and Cambodia the medicines are donated by WHO.
"In , PAHO released a set of operational guidelines for the elimination of fascioliasis as a public health problem in the Americas, a further contribution to the PAHO Elimination Initiative, which seeks to put an end to more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions Information on number of cases detected at health facilities was also reported for 2022, however this is still very fragmentary; a total of 7560 cases of foodborne trematodiases were reported to WHO from only two countries (Egypt and Viet Nam)."

Information shared by countries indicates that 78% of the cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis reported to WHO are treated by the relevant health authorities.
Information on the remaining 22% is missing but it is assumed that a large proportion is in fact also treated.
It can be concluded that the vast majority of cases reported to WHO are managed through one or more of the available curative options.
"In 2022, 99.98% of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases reported globally were treated in six high-burden countries (Afghanistan, Brazil, Colombia, Morocco, Peru and Syrian Arab Republic)."
"Approximately three quarters of all cases are detected in the Eastern Mediterranean region, with the Syrian Arab Republic and Afghanistan accounting for largely more than 50% of the global burden."
"Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 Expanded access to physical therapy (cryotherapy and thermotherapy), integration within the skin NTD approach, and increased supplies of medicines, especially in crisis-affected countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, have enabled a progressive improvement of case detection and management."
"Nevertheless, not all incident cases are detected, and not all detected cases are reported to WHO; in 2022, for example, epidemiological information was not available for five high-burden countries (Algeria, Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia)."
The true incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis remains uncertain; surveys are required to generate information and enable reporting against the indicator.
"The number of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis reported to WHO since 2020, by Region, is shown in Fig."
"Number of reported cutaneous leishmaniasis cases, by WHO region, African WHO target, milestone and achievement Number of countries in which: 85% of all cases are detected and reported and 95% of reported cases are treated Mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses In many countries, systemic fungal infections are not notifiable diseases, which limits the understanding of their geographical distribution, incidence, prevalence and morbidity."
"In the absence of a surveillance system and a register of cases, information available is usually generated by prospective or retrospective surveys."
"In 2023, WHO started collecting information through the GNARF, although this is still fragmentary: in 2022, were reported from seven countries (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Mauritania, Senegal, and Sudan; onecountry, Eritrea, reported zero cases); of them, cases were confirmed by laboratory."
"Also, in 2022, reported from two countries only, Senegal and Sudan; all cases were laboratory confirmed."
"With regard to chromoblastomycosis, only one country, which 81 were laboratory-confirmed."
No cases of paracoccidioidomycosis and sporotrichosis were In only a few countries can health systems rely on more effective services for the active or passive detection of cases and their management.
"These include Brazil, where detection and control of chromoblastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis and sporotrichosis are under the responsibility of the high prevalence of chromoblastomycosis is recorded especially in eastern provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong; Madagascar, one of the leading global foci of chromoblastomycosis; Senegal, where mycetoma is included in the NTD master plan; and Sudan, where the Mycetoma Research Centre of the Khartoum provides diagnostic and curative services to patients throughout the country, and often from neighbouring countries as well."
"At global level, progress was also noted with regard to the evaluation of a new medicine (fosravuconazole) and the publication of a TPP for a diagnostic test, both for mycetoma; access to existing treatment for chromoblastomycosis has also improved."
"The number of cases of mycetoma reported to WHO for 2022, by country, is shown in Fig."
"Number of reported mycetoma cases, by WHO target, milestone and achievement Number of countries in which mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, sporotrichosis and/or paracoccidioidomycosis are included in national control programmes and surveillance systems Scabies and other ectoparasitoses Scabies is ubiquitous, and several countries, notably those with higher income economies, have included management and control of scabies as part of the services they provide to their citizens through the health system; nevertheless, the quantification of the number of such countries is challenging."
"In addition, during 2023, population groups were treated with ivermectin, notably in response to outbreaks, in three high-prevalence provinces in Vanuatu and in areas such as Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh."
"Topical scabicides are still more widely used, for example in the Syrian Arab Republic where a surge of cases has been recorded, notably in camps for displaced people and in earthquake-affected areas."
"In line with the recommendations of the WHO informal consultation on a framework for scabies control held in , WHO is working towards strengthening both public health control and data reporting on scabies."
"A manual for programme managers is being prepared in collaboration with the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (IACS); it will address technical and operational issues such as mapping, implementation of MDA with ivermectin, and monitoring and evaluation."
"The number of cases of scabies reported to WHO for 2022, by Region, is shown in Fig."
"Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 WHO target, milestone and achievement Number of countries having incorporated scabies management in the universal health coverage package of care Number of countries using MDA intervention in all endemic districts Snakebite envenoming is still largely under-reported."
"As a result, data on mortality and morbidity and on access to antivenoms are limited."
"Progress in 2023 includes the progressive accumulation of information on epidemiology and distribution of medically important venomous snakes, particularly in the African Region, where a standardized reporting tool has been adopted The epidemiological data and snake distribution maps are regularly updated on WHOs Snakebite Information and Data Platform ."
The implementation of the regional action plan for prevention and control of snakebite envenoming in South-East Asia is being promoted and rolled-out following its launch in 2022.
"By the end of 2023, three different antivenoms had been endorsed by WHO following a rigorous riskbenefit assessment and are now recommended for procurement by Member States and other parties in the African Region."
"Whilst the market for these products is sub-Saharan Africa, the manufacturers are located in three different continents thus representing a new benchmark that can be applied to other antivenoms for other regions of the world."

"Status of the global NTD response Taeniasis and cysticercosis The programme is relatively new; reliable data on burden of disease are scarce and many countries are still in the process of mapping endemic areas; these include Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Cameroon, Madagascar, Namibia and the United Republic of Tanzania."
"As of 2023, intensified control of Taenia solium taeniasis is implemented in Cambodia, Honduras, Madagascar and Zambia."
"In these countries, MDA in some hyperendemic areas is implemented with praziquantel or niclosamide donated by WHO, except in Honduras where the programme also targets soil-transmitted helminthiases and albendazole is used."
"In Zambia, where taeniasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases are co-endemic, there is good cooperation and synergies between the different programmes, and praziquantel or niclosamide are co-administered with albendazole."
"In Madagascar, praziquantel is administered to treat both schistosomiasis and taeniasis in co-endemic areas, and is coupled with pig vaccination as a fully-fledged One Health intervention."
"Access to antiepileptics for patients affected by neurocysticercosis requires improvement in some regions such as Africa (especially in rural areas), while it is considered satisfactory in others such as Latin America."
"Access to imaging diagnostics (CT/MRI) is problematic in many parts of the world, with widely differing availability, WHO target, milestone and achievement Number of countries with intensified control in hyperendemic areas"
Strategic and technical recommendations have progressed.
The recommendation follows the submission of a formal request by Nigeria on behalf of 32 countries and was subsequently endorsed by the WHO Director-General and publicly announced on 15 .
"The objective of this collaboration is to reinforce all programmatic areas, including surveillance, detection and management of cases, community engagement and capacity-building, advocacy and awareness, research and development, and partnership and resource mobilization."
"Numerous technical products and a variety of operational tools of global relevance were published by WHO in 2023, bringing their total to 48."
Noma: the latest addition to WHOs portfolio of NTDs Information on the burden of noma is scarce: most cases are reported from the African continent.
"Since 2001, the WHO Regional Office for Africas oral health programme has been expanding support with the aim of strengthening services for noma in the most affected areas  as of 2023, 11 priority countries have been identified, located mainly in West Africa."
"Approximately 680 cases, including early to late stages of noma, were reported from these priority countries in 2023."
"Guidance, fact sheets, tools and an online training course have also been developed."
"Several publications reporting on progress made were also released, including the Global report on neglected tropical diseases (the first global report published since 2017) , as well as 10 articles and several updates published in different issues of the Weekly Epidemiological Record With regard to global advocacy, key events included the First Global Meeting on Skin NTDs (Geneva, 2731)  and the Global NTD Programme Partners Meeting (Geneva, 1213 ) ."
"World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day was observed on 30 January, pursuant to World Health Assembly decision WHA74 , under the theme Act Now."
World NTD Day is one of the 13 global health days and weeks currently recognized by WHO.
"As an outcome of advocacy work, NTDs were also mentioned in the Political declaration of the General Assembly high-level meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (A/78/L.2) , and in the Political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage (A/78/L.3) , both adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 5 ."
"Resource mobilization, both internally within WHO, and externally with the aim of bringing more funding to WHO and the global NTD community of national programmes and national and international actors, has been identified as a strategic priority of the WHO Global NTD Programme."
"Consequently, work in this area is progressing, with the profile of NTDs being raised further with visits to parliamentarians in Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and participation at events such as the World Health Summit, a G7 side meeting, and, importantly, towards the end of the year, the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), held in Dubai."
"In the context of the first ever Health Day organized within a COP Conference, during the Reaching the Last Mile Forum 2023, held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, more than US$ 777million was pledged by the global donors community."
"These pledges are poised to enable a major scale up of interventions against lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis in Africa and Yemen during the next years, and to contribute to other significant activities directed against other NTDs."
"The platform currently offers online NTD-related training courses on 26 different topics in 12 languages, bringing the total number of products to 62: these are available in English , French , Spanish , Portuguese , Bahasa Indonesia , Arabic , Russian , Amharic, Catalan , Hausa , Hindi , and Ukrainian ."
"Additional translations are in preparation, both into the above languages, and into new ones such as Chinese As of , total enrolments in NTD-related courses are more than 128000, of which: 15% have a completion rate of 100% (i.e."
An online course on WASH and NTDs was released by WHO in 2023.
"Two more  equipped with artificial intelligence algorithms and a photographic databank are being developed, one to recognize snail intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis and one to orientate the diagnosis of common skin conditions."
A section dedicated to NTDs has been established on the WHO You.
Tube channel  where official videos are posted.
This is complemented by an informal You.
"Messages related to NTDs are regularly disseminated by WHOs corporate Xaccount (formerly Twitter) in coordination with WHOs Less webinars dedicated to NTDs have been organized since movement restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have largely been lifted, but they are still occasionally convened by the Global NTD Programme, also in collaboration with other divisions or (e.g."
"WHO manages most of these donations, which are regulated by a series of memoranda of understanding signed between the Organization and each of the relevant manufacturers, following a rigorous assessment of the quality of medicines."
"Currently, 18 different types of medicines are donated to WHO by 10 manufacturers."
Such donations cover 11 diseases and are fully managed by WHO (Annex 2).
"In addition to reduced treatment of those in need, this situation has been responsible for the expiration of important quantities of medicines, either at manufacturing sites or in-country, especially for products with a relatively short shelf-life (e.g."
"Disruptions to treatment interventions and efforts to prevent expiration of medicines prompted WHO to work with recipient countries to implement stringent monitoring of available stock balances, improve inventory management practices, and account for all the medicines received."
"These measures have enabled countries to retrieve, at national and subnational levels, significant balances of undistributed medicines which were therefore reported as available stock balances in the medicine requests for 2023 and 2024, thus reducing the Notwithstanding the persisting impact of COVID-19, structural challenges continue to affect the supply management cycle for NTD medicines."
"WHO encourages local sourcing of medicines, provided these are of assured quality."
"This is why since 2001 WHO has established processes for prequalification of medical products, including medicines."
"As of , the total number of WHO-prequalified finished pharmaceutical products for NTDs is nine, while that of prequalified active pharmaceutical ingredients is eight."
WHO has also continued the dialogue with existing and potential pharmaceutical companies for low-cost procurement process (e.g.
"The compilation of the list is based on the results of a Paediatric Drug Optimization (PADO) exercise and has the aim of fostering investments Albendazole, mebendazole, diethylcarbamazine citrate and praziquantel."
WHO has also released a watch list containing promising NTD paediatric formulations that are candidates for investigation and development within a time horizon of 510 years.
"Finally, it is worth noting that in , arpraziquantel, the paediatric formulation of praziquantel developed by the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium, received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of schistosomiasis in preschool-aged children ."
"Although no donation programmes are in place for NTD diagnostics to date, in 2023 WHO facilitated the procurement of over 1.1 million individual tests for Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis and yaws, an increase of over 80000 tests from 2022; procurement of diagnostics through WHO is made possible thanks to financial contributions from various partners."
Innovation has been fostered to fill existing gaps in NTD diagnostic tools; 20 TPPs for diagnostics against diseases have been developed so far (Annex 4).
"Two diagnostic TPPs were released in 2023: one for a test to detect Mycobacterium leprae infection among asymptomatic household and familial contacts of leprosy patients for post-exposure prophylaxis regimen , and one on a test to confirm leprosy in individuals with signs and symptoms ."
"In addition, a TPP for animal plasmaderived antivenoms for the treatment of snakebite envenoming in sub-Saharan Africa  was also published in 2023, bringing the total number of TPPs to During 2023, WHO launched a pilot Expert Review Panel for Diagnostics (ERPD) for NTDs, which is expected to facilitate smaller/medium sized manufacturers of NTD diagnostics in gaining WHO endorsement for their products, reassure countries of quality assurance about diagnostic tests available in the market, and foster accessibility."
"Accordingly, two calls inviting manufacturers to submit expressions of interest for product evaluation were issued in 2023, one on k39 rapid diagnostic tests for visceral leishmaniasis, and one on rapid diagnostic tests for lymphatic filariasis."
"Within WHO, the Global NTD Programme connected with the Access to Medicines and Health products division, which is working on diagnostics and laboratory, to align WHOs contributions and impact on diagnostics."
Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 A WHO diagnostic task force has been established WHA76.5s recommendation for strengthening diagnostics capacity where local capacity strengthening is the key area identified.
"The resolution was adopted by the Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly on 30 May 3.1.4 	Monitoring drug efficacy and The development and/or potential emergence of drug resistance against certain medicines for NTDs, in specific areas and populations, is a threat to treatments that have proven to be highly successful in the past."
The progressive emergence of treatment failure is a wellknown phenomenon in kinetoplastid NTDs and leprosy.
"Resistance to anthelminthic medicines is a serious concern that the veterinary sector has faced in recent years, as most of the medicines used in this area are also used to treat parasitic infections in animals."
"Various levels of resistance have been reported from the field in relation to medicines used to treat human African trypanosomiasis (melarsoprol) and, in the past, to pentavalent antimonials and miltefosine employed for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis."
"Antimicrobial resistance has been reported almost in all leprosy medicines (dapsone, rifampicin and ofloxacin) in WHO guidance for monitoring antimicrobial resistance is available for leprosy ."
"Controlled distribution of donated medicines has allowed WHO to support targeted pharmaco-epidemiological surveillance systems to closely monitor their standardized use, safety and efficacy, in over 50 countries."
"Guidance is also available to monitor drug efficacy for medicines used against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases, for which resistance has not yet been detected in humans."
"Currently, schistosomiasis and STH programmes are being monitored in 10 countries through a standardized protocol."
"Closely monitoring drug efficacy is essential, therefore, as is instituting surveillance mechanisms for the monitoring of resistance, defining strategies to delay or curb resistance, and developing an appropriate arsenal of second-line medicines to ensure the continued efficacy of antimicrobials for the treatment of NTDs."
"As of 2021, approximately 1.3 billion people have a disability."
"This number has increased substantially during the past decade due to different demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and extended lifespan, meaning that those affected by disabilities live longer and age with limitations in functioning ()."
"These are often the same populations among whom the highest prevalence At global level, some attention has been given towards addressing gendered NTD inequalities."
"For example, important efforts are being made by the female genital schistosomiasis Integration Group (FIG), which gave oral evidence to the UK Parliaments International Development Committee inquiry on UK Aids impact on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), Women Deliver Conference (Kigali, Rwanda, 1720 ) and International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (Harare, Zimbabwe, 49 )."
"Another example relates to vector control activities, which are an essential component of the interruption Mali: Training community-based distributors under the shade of a tree."
"Consequently in 2023, WHO, FAO and other actors have collaborated in the development of technical guidance on sustainable pesticide management for the benefit of Member States, which NTD programmes are adopting ."
"These reports presented an account of the progress made towards reducing the stigma and social exclusion associated with this condition, and of the challenges faced by affected persons and their families; she also formulated recommendations that would inform the mandate of her successor, Dr Beatriz Miranda Galarza, who started her The epidemiology of NTDs offers pragmatic opportunities to monitor progress at all levels, which should be better measured along the axes of gender, equity and human rights."
"However, this work is still incomplete without a holistic view across all NTDs or even within a specific disease."
"In 2023, additional guidance to support the roll-out of preventive chemotherapy against taeniasis was published on mapping for identification of endemic and high-risk areas , on criteria to exclude people with symptoms and signs of neurocysticercosis from treatment and on the early detection and management of neurological symptoms following administration of anthelminthics."
"This set of guidance has facilitated the scale-up of MDA with praziquantel or niclosamide in Cambodia, Madagascar and Zambia, and with albendazole in Honduras."
"Discussions are also ongoing to expand access to single-dose rifampicin so as to enable the scale-up of post-exposure prophylaxis to contacts of detected leprosy cases, in an effort to reduce incidence of new cases and onward transmission of The skin-NTD approach is rapidly imposing itself as a powerful resource to address the burden of at least diseases with dermatological manifestations, as shown by the interest elicited by the first global meeting on skin NTDs (Geneva, 2731 ) ."
A wide choice of online courses dedicated to NTDs with skin manifestations is available on the Open.
"WHO platform, and a new version of the WHO Skin NTDs mobile application was developed in collaboration with NLR (until No Leprosy Remains) and released in 2023."
"To address the burden of skin NTDs more effectively and efficiently, WHO is encouraging countries to add skin NTD screening"
"The Global vector control response  has been strengthened by activities supported by the Global NTD Programme, such as review of country-level programmes and capacities for surveillance and control, build-up of preparedness and response, update of guidance and operational tools, and implementation of capacity strengthening activities, with the aim of improving case-management and decrease case-fatality rates."
The Global Arbovirus Initiative was launched on as a cross cutting strategy to deal with epidemics of four arboviruses transmitted by Aedes spp.
"The Global Arbovirus Initiatives goal is to strengthen the coordination, communication, capacity-building, research, preparedness and response necessary to mitigate the growing risk of epidemics."
Further work is in progress to align impact of climate change and urbanisation.
"Application of the WASH strategy to NTD activities has somewhat benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, which widely increased practices such as hand-washing, although the impact of these efforts on transmission of relevant NTDs is yet to be fully appreciated."
"An online training course dedicated to the prevention and care of NTDs through WASH was released by WHO in 2023, with the aim of encouraging further synergism between these two programmes, in line with the WASH-NTD strategy released in 2021 ."
"To further strengthen its cross-cutting and systemsbased approach to disease control, in 2023, the WHO Global NTD Programme engaged with the leadership of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme to ensure collaboration in emergency settings and continuation of support to NTD programming and resources during Collaboration with health emergencies programmes has been ongoing for several years, notably in the area of vector-borne diseases such as cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, chikungunya, and especially dengue."
"In addition, new operational linkages have recently been established in the field, for example with regard to the response to the outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis in the South Omo region of Ethiopia, or to the outbreak of tungiasis in South Sudan, for which a three-level organizational response for technical assistance This collaboration is expected to be more formally sanctioned by the establishment of an accelerated dracunculiasis eradication programme, that would benefit from a more direct involvement of health emergencies programmes."
"This and other NTD flagship programmes have been identified with the aim of uniting efforts and maximizing WHOs output towards a defined, The potential role of NTD programmes as a platform for pandemic preparedness has been highlighted, with the consequence that including NTD interventions in national epidemic response and pandemic preparedness plans will lead to stronger health systems and workforces that are better equipped to detect and respond to both existing epidemics and new global health threats."
Decreasing efforts against these diseases can result in a large-scale resurgence of infections that would be even more costly to address and with potentially disastrous consequences  as evidenced in a study to assess the impact of chikungunya on health costs during the epidemic on Runion island in .
"The single specific mention of NTDs in the Political declaration of the General Assembly high-level meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 5October (A/78/L.2) , has left many actors in the global NTD community disappointed."
"It is hoped that the Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response Accord which is currently being negotiated by WHO Member States and is expected to be submitted for consideration by the 77th World Health Assembly in , will include more detailed reference to the need to maintain essential health services, including NTD services, in the context of health emergencies such In this regard, it is worth reminding that NTD services were among the most frequently and severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that although the most recent (fourth) round of the WHO pulse survey on continuity of essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic (carried out between ) registered some improvement in implementation of NTD activities, it also showed that the impact of disruptions remained significant during the period considered, in terms of community-based interventions, health facility-based services, and capacity to respond to NTD outbreaks."
"It is in the interest of all countries and stakeholders to ensure the inclusion of NTDs in epidemic and pandemic preparedness and 3.2.3 	Mainstreaming within During 2023, efforts were dedicated to streamlining, integrating and mainstreaming processes."
"As highlighted above, NTDs were mentioned in the Political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal South Sudan: A person affected by dracunculiasis walking towards the nearest case containment centre."
This is the outcome of advocacy work carried out by WHO and the global NTD community with the aim of seeing coverage of NTD interventions recognized as a tracer for equity on progress towards universal health coverage.
"Although this aspect does not seem to have been explicitly acknowledged by the text of the declaration, the text indeed calls for more efforts to address the specific physical and mental health needs of all people as part of universal health coverage [], by advancing comprehensive approaches and integrated service delivery."
"Furthermore, the declaration recogniz[es] the fundamental role of primary health care in achieving universal health coverage and other Sustainable Development Goals and targets; it is foreseeable that a reinforcement of primary health care will benefit NTD interventions, which largely implemented at the peripheral level of the health system."
"With regard to data collection and analysis, WHO is embarked in a corporate effort to strengthen routine health information systems (RHISs) to improve the use of health service data which are essential for patient management, facility management, disease surveillance, stock management and monitoring of service provision and resource use ."
"In line with this, the WHO Global NTD Programme is working to develop a toolkit and modules to facilitate the integration and mainstreaming of NTDs into national RHISs."
This guidance can be applied to any type of data management software.
"The overall guidance and disease-specific modules for rabies, Buruli ulcer and schistosomiasis are being finalized for release in 2024, to be followed by the remaining disease-specific modules."
RHIS modules for cross-cutting approaches such as vector control and supply chain are also The RHIS modules for NTDs will reduce the administrative burden of reporting by countries and minimize data fragmentation within and beyond NTD programmes.
"During 2023, action was taken to improve the range of forms used by WHO to facilitate the exchange of information related to NTDs with its Member States."
A dedicated country portal was created for each Member State to access and submit the GNARFs.
"The most immediate contribution made by GNARF has been towards obtaining data that are included in the present report and for reporting purposes to the 77th World The GNARF was introduced to Member States in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific and European regions."
"As such, a 41% submission rate was attained during 2023 as the inaugural year."
"In 2023, work was carried out to further improve uptake and use of the PC Joint Application Package (JAP)."
"Dimension-level focus group discussions Participants: Dimension experts, national NTD programme managers, WHO regional office representatives, WHO HQ Purpose: Review disease-specific reports for methodological inconsistencies and develop cross-cutting recommendations."
"Work is still ongoing, and the key outputs from the GAT exercise will be an updated heat map showing progress and challenges towards the 2030 targets."
A total of 25 disease-specific focus group discussions updating four dimensions has been completed.
Version 1 of the JAP was released in 2013.
"Since then, WHO has been collecting feedback from countries and partners on its use to improve the tool."
"Several versions have been released since 2013 to address comments and suggestions received from end-users, such as customization, data validation, analysis of reported data, adaptation to the new strategies and improvement of functionalities and interface."
The last version of JAP (version 4) was released in .
"The forms are available in English, French and Spanish."
"Any countries requiring PC for lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases can request medicines and submit data using the JAP."
"In an effort to foster integration and reduce administrative burden for Member States, the JAP was also adapted for reporting and requesting medicines for echinococcosis, some of the foodborne trematodiases (clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis), taeniasis and yaws."
"Overall, a total of 187 Member States and 24 areas and territories reported information on at least one NTD Finally, efforts have been made to boost data visualization through interactive dashboards."
"Member States, with the support of stakeholders, are increasingly using the WHO M&Eframework  to inform the development of sustainability plans for national programmes which typically take 816 months to complete."
"These government plans are comprehensive in terms of the diseases they include and are specific to individual country needs, with benchmarks defined by the countries health ministries."
"To date, 11 USAID-supported countries have developed national NTD sustainability action plans, of which nine have been validated by the political leadership."
More countries in West Africa are starting the sustainability planning process.
"Additionally, a number of countries, including Ethiopia, United Republic of Tanzania and Yemen, are requesting support for conducting mid-term reviews towards informing sustainability action at Even though similar principles are applied towards a common goal, each countrys process, experience and desired outcomes for sustainability are quite different and provide important peer-to-peer learning for programmes (Box 3.3)."
Ten indicators for tracking country and global progress towards sustainability of NTD programmes have been described .
"WHO is working with Member States to strengthen data collection, reporting and use for these"
Country examples of sustainability for national NTD programmes Ghana - expanding NTD coverage in the national health insurance scheme Ghanas national health policy is centred on a commitment to achieve universal health coverage.
The national health insurance scheme (NHIS) was introduced in 2003 to replace the cash-and-carry system for paying for health-care services at the point of receiving care and has become a key mechanism for ensuring health equity and social protection.
Its quest to sustainably provide morbidity management and disability prevention care to individuals affected by NTDs through the existing health system is gaining traction.
"Beyond meeting the need to provide care without exposing individuals and their families to catastrophic health expenditures, NHIS is now being regarded as a potential solution to overcome both perceived and experienced financial barriers that contribute to late presentation and worse NTD disability outcomes."
"Since 2022, the Intra-Country Coordination Committee for NTDs (ICCC) within the Ghana Health Service has been working on expanding the NHIS coverage for NTDs with support from the USAIDs Act to End NTDs | West Program."
A comprehensive desk review was performed following a meeting in June to sensitize stakeholders on the framework for expanding the NHIS benefits package with respect to NTD services.
This was followed by technical consultations to develop a comprehensive costing framework to guide the inclusion of NTD services within the NHIS benefits packages and revision of all NTD management protocols for for the revision of Ghanas Essential Medicines List and NHIS benefits package.
ICCC has facilitated a high-level consultation with decision-makers to seek commitment to including new NTD services within NHIS and shared a policy brief and formal request to complete the expansion of the NHIS benefits packages.
This landmark was achieved through systematic data-driven advocacy.
"A landscape analysis was conducted to identify the relevant stakeholders, determine the existing barriers and design applicable strategies targeting effective domestic resource mobilization."
A tool for enhancing resource mobilization and allocation for NTDs in districts has been developed and NTDs.
Discussions are ongoing on the results of this exercise and how it will feed into future workplans.
"Unlike some high-profile diseases or intervention programmes that have a pooled funding mechanism, NTD programmes have diverse and often one-disease international donors."
"Nevertheless, the financing difficulties faced by WHOs Global NTD Programme could be representative of the wider picture: since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Programme has faced funding withdrawal or cuts from several major donors, which continue to cause severe budget restrictions and have led to a significant reduction in workforce."
"The findings revealed significant funding gaps1 for MDA planned in 2024 against lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminthiases: depending on the disease, 10% to 35% of the implementation units were found to be without secure funding to cover the cost of their planned MDA campaign."
"The funding gap for monitoring and evaluation activities was even more pronounced, ranging from 11% to 46%."
Data from 29 low and lower-middle-income countries in 2018 were used to illustrate national investment in NTD programmes in the Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2023 .
"However, since 2018, the number of countries reporting fully disaggregated health expenditure data by disease (including NTDs) has been decreasing quickly."
"In 2020, only six countries reported expenditure on NTDs, including zero expenditure, in the GHED, which is not sufficient to constitute a representative sample for Lack of economic data has become a key obstacle to effective advocacy for investing in NTD interventions."
"One way to address this, without overburdening countries, is to support countries in recording their national expenditure on NTD programmes through a health account exercise with full disease disaggregation; that is, an accounting framework for systematically tracking health spending."
"In parallel, at regional and country level, WHO has also intensified work towards generating economic information for resource mobilization."
"This initiative was accompanied by a financial resource requirement plan encompassing nine countries.1 The plan included estimates of the cost for implementing priority interventions recommended by WHO in the target countries during the period .2 To evaluate the feasibility, added value and impact of integrating interventions directed against different NTDs, WHO also supported a pilot activity in Cte d. Ivoire aimed at integrating screening for skin NTDs into a planned MDA campaign against schistosomiasis."
The integrated intervention was successfully conducted in  in two districts in Cte d. Ivoire.
The data on the cost and impact of such integration have been collected and are currently being analysed in view of their dissemination.
The effort to change operating models and culture has also relied on a diverse set of actions.
The financial resource requirement plan is an unpublished WHO document .
"As of , more than 50 NTDendemic countries have a master plan; some plans have now reached the third generation."
NTD master plans are essential strategic documents for governments to effectively plan and implement sustainable NTD programmes in concertation with all relevant stakeholders.
They are expected not only to reinforce national ownership but also to establish programmatic priorities and strengthen the health system and other sectors to deliver NTD services more effectively and efficiently.
The translation of master plans into detailed and budgeted annual workplans can represent the first step towards addressing specific challenges in a timely and action-oriented manner and serve as a core subject of discussion in the process of establishing country coordination platforms facilitating exchange of information among all actors.
"Other activities aimed at reinforcing coordination, promoting a sense of oneness, and progressing towards a shared purpose included the establishment of a network that brings together the more than 50 WHO Collaborating Centres working on NTDs, which was launched on World NTD Day 2023, through a dedicated webinar convened at the initiative of the WHO Collaborating Center for Tropical Diseases, Institute of Parasitic Diseases (IPD), Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (China CDC)."
Key highlights and progress achieved in each region for the current reporting period are summarized below.

Conclusions and way forward NTD programmes were severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis.
"During the earliest phases of the pandemic, prevention, treatment and care services for NTDs were the second most frequently disrupted across the entire health system spectrum, after those targeting mental, neurological and substance use disorders, and were the most affected in terms of the proportion of countries reporting severe disruptions."
"Community-based interventions, health-facility-based activities and capacity to respond to NTD outbreaks were jeopardized, resulting in lower numbers of people suffering from these diseases being detected and treated, and reduced coverage rates for interventions such as preventive chemotherapy."
The need for resources required to accompany a full post-COVID-19 recovery has increased.
"While it may have been expected that the progressive decrease in the public health relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic would see a return to normal funding levels, this has not happened for NTD programmes, despite several advocacy events being held in 2022 and 2023."
"As of , the financial support available to NTD programmes is still far below pre-pandemic levels and is still limited at all levels."
"This is jeopardizing programme activities, hampering meaningful planning, and preventing effective coordination globally and regionally."
Challenges likewise are not limited to a slow post.
COVID-19 recovery: persistent gaps in knowledge and operational tools are preventing the development or production of programme-ready diagnostics and more effective treatments and vaccines.
"These gaps are also hampering the fully-fledged implementation of surveillance, vector control, veterinary public health and WASH interventions, as well as the adaptation of strategic approaches to global challenges such as climate change."
This may have a significant negative impact on consolidated epidemiological scenarios and jeopardize health gains made to date.
"Suboptimal technical and programmatic capacity in some national programmes has been noted, as has a lack of, or weak, cross-sectoral engagement to address the key NTD determinants that require multisectoral collaboration."
"Lagging government ownership is resulting in insufficient coordination, inefficient use of resources, inadequate funding and slow adoption of new NTD interventions, while conflict and humanitarian crises are affecting programme implementation and progress and heightening the risk of NTDs in affected populations."
A particular example is the steady but insufficient progress being made in the reduction in the number of people requiring interventions against NTDs.
"Conversely, good progress has been made for the number of countries acknowledged for having eliminated at least one NTD , and for the total number of acknowledgement processes completed ."
"Six countries were acknowledged in 2023, including Bangladesh, for two diseases."
The fact that 13 countries (as of ) have eliminated more than one NTD is cause for celebration.
Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 There are limitations in tracking some of the indicators included in the M&Eframework.
"DALYs data relating to NTDs are challenging, in terms of both their completeness and their timeliness, and there are difficulties associated with collecting reliable data on a number of NTDs."
"Cross-cutting indicator6: Share of the population at risk protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure due to neglected tropical diseases Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) can be very expensive to treat, especially in their late stages."
Monitoring of progress towards this indicator has been facing data challenges.
There is no mechanism at country level to collect household expenditure on the costs of treatment for NTDs.
"As a result, existing data sources were used as proxies to calculate the financial risk faced by the NTD community, with the limitation that calculations focus not on health expenditure due to NTDs but rather on any health expenditure among Financial protection against health expenditure is at the core of universal health coverage, and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 3.8.2 monitors the health-related financial hardship faced by a population.1 When household expenditure on health exceeds a certain percentage of the total household expenditure or income, it will be considered catastrophic."
"Two thresholds for SDG 3.8.2 have been proposed: 10% or As populations at risk of NTDs often have low capacity to pay, the lower threshold was chosen; the percentage of population with household expenditures on health greater than 10% of total household expenditure or Definition of SDG 3.8.2: Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income."
Two thresholds are used to define large household expenditure on health: greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income .
The proxy of the population at risk of NTDs is SDG 3.3.5: Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases.
"When this calculation was made, SDG 3.3.5 data were updated to 2021."
"Data for SDG 3.8.2, however, are often not available annually across countries."
"If the time dimension is added, equation 1 would be modified as follows: i (SDG 3.8.2i, latest year  SDG 3.3.5i, 2021) Based on equation 2, in 2021, 12.6% of the global population at risk of NTDs encountered catastrophic health spending: that is, 87.4% of the population at risk of NTDs was protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure."
The above calculations should be interpreted with caution.
"For example, SDG 3.8.2 data are often not recent."
"However, if the 36 countries with SDG 3.8.2 data older than 10 years are removed from the analysis, the"
"Additionally, by using SDG 3.8.2 as a proxy for the financial risk faced by the population at risk of NTDs, it is assumed that such population has the same financial risk as the national average."
"However, populations living in poverty, such as those affected by NTDs, are often more vulnerable to financial risk, and SDG 3.8.2 could therefore underestimate the financial risk of the population affected by NTDs."
"The international poverty line currently used by the World Bank is US$2.15 To apply this approach, SDG 3.8.2 was replaced in equation 2 by the share of the population pushed below the US$2.15 per person per day poverty line due to household health expenditure."
"Data older than 10 years were deleted, resulting in a database of 114countries."
"According to this calculation, in 2021, globally, people at risk of NTDs were pushed below the poverty line by their health expenditure."
"This approach has an additional limitation: since it focuses on the population living close to the poverty line, it can only be used to complement SDG 3.8.2; it cannot replace the first approach detailed above."
"The indicator population pushed further below the poverty line by household health expenditures needs further refinement, such as more data quality checks, and understanding before it can be used as a proxy for the population at risk of NTDs."
"Comparison of financial protection (%) between the full sample (green) and the sample excluding SDG 3.8.2 data that are older than 10years as of 2021 (orange), by WHO region AFR: WHO African Region; AMR: WHO Region of the Americas; EUR: WHO European Region; EMR: WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region; SEAR: WHO South-East Asia Region; WPR: WHO Western Pacific Region."

Digitising health facility operations is aimed at reducing the burden of reporting stemming from the use of paper-based tools and subsequent data quality issues.
Significant improvements in health service delivery has been reported in health facilities utilising the Electronic Medical Records System (EMRS).
"The main achievements registered so far are reduced reporting burden and However, the processes related to implementation such as service workflow re-engineering, functionalization of health analytics, meaningful information exchange, and governance of EMRS have been mostly undefined to date."
"Health facility planning and operations driven by evidence, leveraging digital health solutions to improve health service delivery."
These guidelines are intended for the
"Stakeholders from various entities such as the Development Partners, Technology and Implementing Partners, Academia and other members of the Health Information Innovation and Research Technical Working Group (HIIRE TWG) supported the generation of a draft which was reviewed and later validated."
"The validated guidelines were endorsed by the Management Committee (SMC), and approved by Top Management for implementation within the 1.8 Guiding Principles Used to Develop this Document 5."
"For the Public Sector, the Division of Health Information Management (DHIM) shall coordinate the user requirements, system design and development process and provide overall guidance during this phase with oversight from the HIIRE TWG."
The client is the primary recipient of health services at the health facility level.
These characteristics should be taken into account when enrolling health facility clients into specific health facility services.
"Health facility services include but are not limited to casualty outpatient services including but not limited to immunization, maternal and child health, dental, eye, counseling, family planning, health promotion, nutrition, Antenatal Care (ANC), Postnatal care (PNC), and inpatient services but not limited to maternity, intensive care, among others."
Caregivers of clients receiving health services are also included in this group.
The Health Worker is the primary agent of health service delivery at the health facility level.
Their main role is to provide health facility services while passively collecting key program data.
Health facility supervisors oversee service delivery points within their area of assignment and provide support to other health workers.
The involvement in the day-to-day health facility operations is supervisory and aimed at assessing and promoting service quality.
Health facility supervisors shall access EMRS dashboards and supervisor views constituting key information necessary to provide insights on how best they can supervise and support  the health workers.

"Ethics: Equity, safe use, data privacy and protection: These principles are vital for ensuring the social inclusion of the EMRS."
"The User Acceptance Testing report will be signed off once all the raised issues are addressed and Management will be responsible for the sign-off of UATs while for the Private Sector, the ownership of the health facilities will sign off the UTAs."
All health facilities implementing EMRS shall have the same version of the system and therefore a mechanism shall be put in place to ensure uniformity in rolling out updates for EMRS across all Public Sector EMRS shall be branded to have a national outlook consistent with the national information systems for purposes of ownership.
The EMRS shall have the following branding; 1.
EMRS in the Private Sector shall be branded following the guidance on branding by the ownership of the health facilities where the EMRS is to be deployed.
All parties intending to implement EMRS should seek guidance and approval from Mo.
"This shall check if resources are planned to support the rollout of the EMR in the selected health facility and this includes but is not limited to; finances, human resources, hardware, and software."
This is to ensure there are adequate human resources at the national level to support further training and mentorship at the health facilities that have adopted the use of the EMRS.
H and partners shall develop a detailed EMRS deployment work plan and budget following the sample training schedule in Appendix Cand sample EMRS deployment budget in Appendix Ddetailing how the health facility shall roll out and coordinate the deployment of the EMRS within the health facility.
"EMRS deployment end-user training shall not commence until all the needed computing infrastructure i.e LAN has been installed within the health facility and tested for The computing infrastructure installations shall be signed off the health facility in charge once successful tests have been conducted with a test report shared with the health facility in Once the computing infrastructures have been installed, the next step is the configuration and installation of the EMRS software."
The ICT devices handed over shall be distributed according to the Health Facility EMRS Digitisation Plan and ensure all service points are well equipped.
Pre -Training/Preparation Phase The training team shall ensure that all requirements detailed in the EMRS deployment checklist (Appendix E) are met ahead of the training.

"After the five  days of transition, the HMIS manual registers shall only be used as a backup mechanism in the event the EMRS is non-functional as per the Standard Operating Procedures of the EMRS Downtime as indicated in Appendix F. Once the EMRS functionality has been restored, all the data captured using the manual registers shall be transferred as the Standard Operating Procedure."
Thereafter yearly refresher training is recommended to address any area of interest as may be pointed out by the national and subnational levels or informed by changes 3.
"The HIS Support is a multi-sectoral approach to harness resources relating to infrastructure, human resources, and overall capacity for the proper functioning of digital health solutions."
"System users shall utilise the support structures in place and communication channels to escalate any system issue, downtime or feature that is needed for continued improvement of the EMRS."
"The support structure is 5 tier (0-4) to support the various levels of EMRS implementation with the escalation procedures in Appendix G. The tier three , expert technical support at the national level shall be engaged through official communication channels established and elaborated below; The call center shall be the first point of contact for all help requests that originate from the end users of the EMRS at different levels."
In the event that the call center team is unable to
Issues shall be logged in the call center Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software for tracking and management until they are resolved.
Some of the system user issues could have been solved in the past and the solutions exist on the HIS Community of Practice webpages.
A copy of the same shall be kept at the 4) Private health facilities shall ensure that the data from the EMRS to be discontinued is backed up and safely kept following the ICT policy or backup procedures in place.
"In that case, two EMRS shall be utilized within the health facilities until further 3.5 EMRS Change Management This guideline ensures standardized methods; processes and procedures are used for all changes, and maintain proper balance between the need for change and the potential detrimental impact of changes."
Effective change management is very crucial in Health facility settings for controlling changes to EMRS and other supporting systems within the live Health facility environment.
If satisfied that the reason for the change is sound and that there is no adverse effect as a result of the change.
Change approval: The concerned user the results produced are as expected and a user acceptance testing (UAT) form shall be signed
"For the avoidance of doubt, no scheduled system change should be effected in the live EMRS during a busy business cycle."
"In the event that the change made produces unexpected results, the backup taken before the change was effected has to be used to restore the system to the point before the change."
Compliance with the Personal Data Protection and Privacy Act 2019 is critical as the EMRS collects individual-level data which is classified as personal data according to the law.
Below is further guidance on 1.
The district and national levels shall have access to system reports with the exception of the time during responses to public health emergencies like outbreaks for surveillance purposes.
"By adhering to established standards and guidelines, the EMRS guarantees that patient information is exchanged accurately, efficiently, and confidentially."
The expected reports with the frequency to be submitted by the EMRS is detailed in the Weekly Epidemiological Surveillance VHT/ICCM Quarterly Report NTDS MDA Implementation Report Specialized Outpatient monthly report Child Immunization Addendum Report Palliative Care Monthly Report Sub County Annual Population Projection Report Health Facility Human Resource Inventory
Below are the specific requirements besides the general guidance on EMRS implementation to be adhered to by the Private Sector.
"The Governance of EMRS shall follow the existing governance and management structures at the national and decentralized levels, as summarized in Technical oversight is the mandate of the Division of Health Information Management (DHIM) stakeholders involved in health data collection, processing and storage."
"This function is similarly decentralized at the Local Government level, as summarized in Information Innovation and Research Technical Working Group (HIIRE TWG) is reviewing and advising on Health Information System (HIS) and Digital Health policy-related and strategic related management structures which act as advisory committees to Management Committee."
All the other HIIRE TWG subcommittees like the Data Management Subcommittee and Digital Health Subcommittees shall provide technical input towards the implementation of the EMRS in the The Digitisation Steering Committee chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the has been established as a special committee to ensure fast tracking of the implementation of the EMRS and other digital initiatives in the country.
Governance of the Private Sector EMR implementation shall be under the leadership of the ownership of the health facilities and will interface with the Governance Structure illustrated in 5.1 EMRS Implementation Arrangements EMRS implementation shall require that all the responsibilities of all stakeholders are spelt out in order to streamline the implementation arrangements and strengthen the governance framework.
Plan and ensure that health facilities are connected to the national electrical grid.
"Compliance with the guidelines shall be monitored through health facility self-assessments every quarter submitted to Furthermore, it is necessary to track and evaluate the implementation and functioning of the system in order to understand how well the implementation objectives have been met and the effect of EMRS on the day-to-day health facility operations."
Important to note is that dissemination and training on the use of the guidelines is a key requirement before monitoring its use can become a practical reality.
These are described further below and shall be tracked and assessed to measure guideline use.
"Notably, it is critical to continue monitoring EMRS deployment nationwide to ensure that the software is working as it should, every activity is implemented as planned, and that external factors are not affecting the potential effectiveness of the Findings from deployment monitoring activities shall be synthesized, disseminated, and remedial action taken to address identified challenges."
They are described further below and shall be tracked and assessed to ensure that the intervention is doing things right.
"Post-deployment and/or at a later maturity stage (i.e., where the EMRS applications have been fully designed and only enhancements are required to meet evolving policy changes and information needs), basic system functionality monitoring shall be conducted before introducing the EMRS to"
Initial (pre-deployment) system stability monitoring shall be conducted during quality assurance testing sessions before the EMRS is declared ready for deployment (field-ready).
"Post-deployment, stability shall be monitored to mitigate any events that may result in improper delivery of the EMRS intervention such as unexpected crash or stop, slow response times especially during peak times or when overloaded, and any erratic performance hindering management and use of EMRS."
Fidelity: Refers to a measure of whether or not an intervention is delivered as intended in terms of technical and user perspectives.
"For instance, the standards related to capabilities of EMRS end-users and content of the inputs used for the programmatic interventions that e. EMRS is designed to deliver such as algorithms for decision support, data collection forms, and reports."
This content should be of
EMRS quality monitoring shall focus on ensuring (a) data quality and regularity by checking for outliers of non-compliant users; and (b) quality of content to be delivered is as expected and inline with existing standards and appropriate for participating communities.
The following evaluation components shall constitute the EMRS evaluation framework in addition to the evaluation types: Feasibility: Assess whether  EMRS works as intended in various contexts and health facility Usability: Assess whether the EMRS is used as intended.
"Depending on EMRS degree of maturity and evidence needs, several evaluation types categorized as formative or summative may be commissioned and/or conducted."
Summative evaluations: Studies conducted at the end or a certain phase of the intervention to determine the extent to which expected outcomes have been achieved.
Appendix E: EMRS Rollout Checklist The EMRS Rollout planning checklist is intended to aid the trainers in planning for EMRS implementation.
It can be used to plan for the EMR system go-live event and to identify any issues that need to be addressed beforehand.

"Special appreciation goes to the staff within the Division of Health Information Management (DHIM), Information Communication Technology (ICT) Section and the Community Health guidelines are aligned with the Health Information and Digital Health Strategic Plan 2020/212024/25 and the National Community Health Strategy 2020/21-2024/25."
"Community - A Specific group of people, usually living in a defined geographical area, who share common values, norms, culture, and customs, and are arranged in a social structure according to relationships which the community has collectively developed over a period of time."
"They are selected and trained, on a variety of tasks such as home visits, sanitation, first aid, MNCH and family planning activities, TB and HIV/AIDS care etc."
Village Health Team (VHT) - The Village Health Team is a voluntary community-based (village) structure whose members are selected by the people themselves to promote the health and wellbeing of the people in their areas of residence/jurisdiction.
It is the lowest health delivery structure and serves as a Health Centre I.
"Digital Health - Digital health is the systematic application of information and communications technologies, computer science, and data to support informed decision-making by individuals, the health workforce, healthcare organizations, and health systems, to strengthen resilience to disease and improve health and wellness."
Community Health Information System (CHIS) - This is an integrated information system that supports health service delivery at the community level.
Electronic Community Health Information Systems (e. CHIS) - The electronic Community Health Information System (e. CHIS) is a digital job aid for community health workers which also digitizes the paper-based health information management system and programme workflows.
"Workflows - A sequence of steps or processes from initiation to completion during health service Data Element - A basic unit of information that has a unique meaning and subcategories (data items) of distinct value for example gender, race, and geographic location."
The community platform supported by Community Health Workers is responsible for household production and modifying the social determinants of health.
This is aimed at reducing the burden of reporting stemming from the use of paper-based tools and subsequent data quality issues.
Significant improvements in community service delivery have been reported in districts implementing the electronic Community Health Information System (e. CHIS).
"The main achievements registered so far are  reduced reporting burden and  improved data However, the processes related to implementation such as service workflow re-engineering, functionalization of health analytics, meaningful information exchange, and governance of e. CHIS have been mostly undefined to date."
A highly consultative approach was used in the development of the e. CHIS guidelines.
"Stakeholders from various entities such as the (LGs), Development Partners, Technology and Implementing Partners, Academia and other members of the Health Information Innovation and Research Technical Working Group (HIIRE TWG) supported the generation of a draft which was reviewed and later validated."
"The validated guidelines were endorsed by the Management Committee (SMC), and approved by Top Management for implementation within 1.6 Guiding Principles Used to Develop this Document 5."
"The Division of Health Information Management (DHIM) shall coordinate the user requirements, system design and development process and provide overall guidance during this phase with oversight from the HIIRE TWG."
The client is a member of the community and a primary recipient of community health services.
These characteristics should be taken into account when enrolling community members into specific community health services.
"Clients are normally organized into households, with each household having one member as the household head."
"Community health services include but are not limited to immunization, health/nutrition assessments and referrals, family planning, health promotion, nutrition, pregnancy mapping, Antenatal care (ANC), and Postnatal care (PNC)."
Caregivers of clients receiving health services are also included in this group.
Their main role is to provide community health services while passively collecting key program data.
CHWs are normally members of the communities in which they
"The CHW Coordinators/CHEWs are CHWs but with a better understanding of the programmatic requirements, reporting needs and overall functionality of the e. CHIS."
These deliver mentorship and coaching to fellow CHWs and are the first line of support (to CHWs) in terms of troubleshooting issues or overcoming challenges associated with the e. CHIS.
CHW Supervisors are responsible for supervising and overseeing the delivery of CHW activities.
The CHW Supervisors are full-time salaried government employees charged with the management of health service delivery at the community level.
"However, their visits are typically supervisory and are aimed at assessing and promoting service quality."
"In particular, they are responsible for distributing commodity supplies to CHWs, as well as verifying and escalating reports of notifiable diseases or events of public health interest."
CHW Supervisors shall access e. CHIS dashboards and supervisor views constituting key information necessary to provide insights on how best they can supervise and support the CHWs.
The District Health Team (DHT) is responsible for the management of healthcare programs at the district level.

A strong system design is crucial to the development and functionalization of the e. CHIS to produce real-time quality information for decision-making.
"Through the design process, developers and programme teams understand the healthcare processes, persona user stories, unique data use requirements for each persona, the different healthcare workflows and how they are delivered in the community, the way users interface with the e. CHIS technologies, and how to continue to build The human-centred design approach and analytical development methods shall be used to understand the user requirements while considering the bottlenecks and challenges that users face."
"It seeks to understand how people do their work, how they perceive their health services, and how they experience challenges and may envision solutions."
"The outcome is information-oriented, resulting in a user requirements document or Therefore a participatory approach that allows users and stakeholders to contribute to the design and development process shall be used in a blended manner, that is to say, utilizing both humancentered design and the analytical approach."
Usability: Design and develop the e. CHIS application in a way that shall minimize the complexity for end users interacting with it.
Availability: Ensure both system and data is available to digital health applications and their end users whenever needed (within the bounds of confidentiality) to guarantee client safety and business continuity.
"Ethics: Equity, safe use, data privacy and protection: These principles are vital for ensuring the social inclusion of the e. CHIS."
The User Acceptance Testing report shall be signed off once all the raised issues are addressed and validated by the user responsible for coordinating the sign-off of UATs.
All parties intending to implement e. CHIS should seek guidance and approval from Mo.
"A readiness assessment using the e. CHIS deployment checklist (Appendix 1) for the proposed Local Government shall be conducted to check the readiness of the Local Government and the are planned to support the rollout of the e. CHIS in the selected Local Government and this includes but is not limited to; finances, human resources, hardware, software, approved CHW lists, and draft device management agreements among others."
H or partners shall be handed over to the Local Governments who shall ensure they are captured within the district or city inventory list for purposes of tracking.
Pre -Training/Preparation Phase The training team shall ensure that all requirements in the e. CHIS deployment checklist are met ahead of the training (Appendix 5).
Manual registers shall only be used as a backup mechanism in the event the e. CHIS is non-functional.
"Once the e. CHIS functionality has been restored, all the data captured using the manual registers shall be transferred."
The supportive supervision by the Health Assistant or CHW Supervisor shall be conducted monthly to support the CHWs close performance and data quality gaps d) Peer mentorship by CHW Coordinators The CHW coordinator shall support/mentor the peer CHWs on at least a Bi-monthly basis should the CHWs have any queries or challenges.

CHIS implementation modalities.
Important to note is that dissemination and training on the use of the guidelines are key requirements before monitoring its use can become a practical reality.
They are described further below and shall be tracked and assessed to measure guideline use.
"Notably, it is critical to continue monitoring e. CHIS deployment nationwide to ensure that the software is working as it should, that every activity is implemented as planned, and that external factors are not affecting the potential effectiveness of the e. CHIS intervention."
They are described further below and shall be tracked and assessed to ensure that the intervention is doing things right.
"Postdeployment and/or at a later maturity stage (i.e., where the e. CHIS applications have been fully designed and only enhancements are required to meet evolving policy changes and information needs), basic system functionality monitoring shall be conducted before introducing the e. CHIS to new users (e.g., a different cadre of health workers) and new geographic areas that might pose different levels of connectivity or when using new Stability: Refers to the likelihood that e. CHIS functions shall not change or fail during use or the ability of e. CHIS to remain functional under both normal and anticipated peak conditions for data loads."
Initial (pre-deployment) system stability monitoring shall be conducted during quality assurance testing sessions before e. CHIS app is declared ready for deployment (field-ready).
"Post-deployment, stability shall be monitored to mitigate any events that may result in improper delivery of the e. CHIS intervention such as unexpected crash or stop, slow response times especially during peak times or when overloaded, and any erratic performance hindering management and use of e. CHIS."
Fidelity: Refers to a measure of whether or not an intervention is delivered as intended in terms of technical and user perspectives.
"For instance, the standards related to the capabilities of e. CHIS end-users and content of the inputs used for the programmatic interventions that e. CHIS is designed to deliver such as algorithms for decision support, data collection forms, and SMSs (Family."
"This content should be of the highest quality possible informed by existing practice, literature and formative research in the local context to increase the effectiveness of the e. CHIS intervention."
Usability: Assess whether e. CHIS is used as intended.
"Depending on the e. CHIS degree of maturity and evidence needs, several evaluation types categorized as formative or summative may be commissioned and/or conducted."
Formative evaluations: Studies aimed at informing the design and development of effective intervention strategies conducted before or during implementation of an Summative evaluations: Studies conducted at the end or a certain phase of the intervention to determine the extent to which expected outcomes have been achieved.

Further details can be obtained from the Implementation Guidelines respective technical areas.
"As such, there is a need for data sharing across healthcare delivery at different levels for purposes of planning and decision-making."
Data to be collected is defined based on the health information needs of the country and it flows from the very first healthcare delivery level management has been adopted to support the various data handling processes as shown in
Digital solutions implemented at the data collection stage are required to transmit the defined HMIS data set to e. HMIS/DHIS2.
"While international donors and health agencies have increased investment in ICT to support Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) in recent years, these investments have often resulted in a proliferation of pilot efforts rather than efforts to scale projects."
"Digital health systems and applications are often developed and implemented ad hoc, to meet the immediate requirements of specific activities or projects, with a limited focus on scalability."
"As a result, solutions that are successful in one locale are often unable to be integrated with other data systems or adopted by other, similar programs."
The majority of the innovations have focused on the adoption of new products or services by individuals and their market-driven diffusion to the population at large.
These innovations have typically emerged from negotiations between diverse stakeholders who compete to impose or at least prioritise their preferred version of that innovation.
"Thus, while many digital health interventions have succeeded in terms of adoption by a substantial number of end users, they have generally failed to gain the level of acceptance required for their integration into national health systems that would promote"
This tremendous duplication of effort has not only led to a waste of resources but has also resulted in more complicated health systems.
"Rather than improve information flows among stakeholders, this series of nonintegrated health systems has created disjointed information islands that have become barriers to effective communication."
"Furthermore, the useful lifespan of many projects is often determined by the availability of limited donor funding, and thus many cease to operate once initial development funding ends."

"The development of this health commodities supply chain policy development framework has been informed by the WHO guidelines for policy formulation, and other literature in the global health policy discourse."
"Iwould like to particularly recognise the commitment and dedication of Dr. Fred Sebisubi, Ms. Martha Ajulong, and Mr. Thomas Ocwa Obua for ensuring that the process remained on track and that the policy document framework was delivered on time."
Health is a fundamental human right.
"Access to health care, including access to essential medicines and health supplies (EMHS), is critical in realizing that right."
"If available, affordable, of good quality and  properly used, EMHS can offer a simple, cost-effective answer to many health challenges (WHO, 2001)1."
"Whereas EMHS have obvious medical and economic importance, there are still widespread problems with lack of access, poor quality, irrational use and wastage(ibid)."
An important aspect in the realization of this mission is the availability and proper use of EMHS.
"An efficient and effective supply chain system of EMHS is, therefore, of paramountimportance."
One of the essential functions of government is public policy development and review to match the ever changing environment.
A policy is pivotal to every action the government takes and it provides a framework within which all actions for the achievement of the national objective are carried out.
This Health commodities SC policy development and review framework is designed to of Health (Mo.
How to develop and Implement a national drug policy.
The resultant supply chain structures should convey a high level of accountability and transparency that facilitates optimal coordination and communication among stakeholders.
In addition these should provide solutions to identified gaps in the supply chain systems aligned with the priorities in the NPSSP IV.
The Policy Development steps are essential components of this framework.
"They outline the core elements that are critical to the successful development, approval, implementation, and review of policies, procedures, directives, standards, protocols orguidelines."
Definitions are also provided for other tools that may be used to support a policy in order to achieve a specific objective.
"A policy is a formal, concise, and an accessible statement on how an entity, in this case the Mo."
"Generally, it is a statement"
"It is a series of decisions as to what shall be done and how, where, by who and when?."
"A policy is a product of conscious effort, a relationship of government unit to its environment, and shows whether the government is in action orinaction."
Policy is a never ending series of communicative and technical act by which all kinds of policy actions collectively engage themselves in the construction of inter-subjective political meaning and at the same time transform these meanings to construct them into collective actions.
"It is thus, both the input and the output of the same decision making process."
"A policy statement reduces the risk of conflict, and removes the opportunity for unfair selective A Regulation is developed by an entity to operationalize provisions of the principal law."
"More often, an entity may not develop its own regulations, but it is rather obliged by law to follow regulations associated with specific legislation and governed by the existing laws."
A procedure is a written statement that describes how a policy or specific legislation will be put into action within an entity.
A procedure does not require approval by policy or area committee but should be approved by the relevant Leadership Team.
"Where linked to a policy, a procedure can be amended in isolation from the associated policy."
A protocol is a system of internally agreed rules that explains the correct conduct and procedures to be followed in identified situations.
A guideline is a document that outlines best practices in implementation of a policy or procedure.
"Guidelines are not mandatory, but help employees follow the rules while allowing for flexibility and common sense in different scenarios."
Guideline do not require approval by policy or area committee and can be reviewed and refreshed as required.
Strategic plan A strategic plan is a document that establishes the direction of an organization.
There are certain
It is likely that specific processes and procedures will exist for these types of plans that will ensure appropriate governance.
A strategic plan should not be used to identify a statement of intent without seeking the appropriate consultation and approval.
"Principles of the policy development Principles are fundamental to guiding the development, approval, implementation, and review of policy documents across ministries."
"The following principles are consistent with best practice and are written to support and align with the mandate of the When consistently incorporated, the following principles will assist with achieving the Principles of Policy Development Process Commitment and collaboration Consistence with the laws, regulations and standards Comprehensive decision-making Monitoring and evaluation 2.1."
No supply chain policy should be in conflict with or 2.2.
"Commitment and collaboration: Development, approval, implementation, and review of HSC policies are built upon the technical commitment and political will coupled with multi-sectoral, stakeholder, and 2.3."
"Consistence with the existing laws, regulations and standards: The content of supply chain policies must adhere to legislation (Acts and Regulations) and organizational requirements, expectations and standards, and take into account what is both practical and reasonable."
"Comprehensive decision-making: The level of support and the approach taken for development, approval, implementation, or review of policies is a negotiated decision, based on urgency, rationality, organizational"
"Decision making is preceded by a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the policy problem and  followed  by  specification of alternative courses of action,  and  the selection of  a course of  action  to  be taken that will maximize benefits and minimize costs."
"Change management: Change management concepts are incorporated into the overall planning and development, approval, implementation, and review processes."
"Resource use efficiency: Resources needed for development, initial implementation and the transition to full scale operations are part of the considerations and decisions made prior to starting policy development activities."
"Accountability and resources use efficiency must be taken Policies must be relevant to stakeholder needs, demonstrate consideration of feedback, and are based on accepted or evidence-based practice."
"In addition, they should be flexible and adaptive to the emerging challenges andtrends."
They should also be easily interpreted and/or translated for proper 2.9.
"Monitoring and evaluation: Monitoring and Evaluation is a key mechanism for sustainability of the policy development process and ongoing improvement, leading to long- term benefit for the organization."
"The policies must have specific, measurable, attainable, reliable, and time bound (SMART) 2.10."
"Knowledge transfer: This involves training and capacity building for the staff to foster understanding, build organizational capacity, and improve compliance with the Policy Development and Review Framework and Policy Development."
"This ensures that the policy cycle is continuous with regular monitoring and review, allowing the adaptation to change."
The cyclic nature of the policy development process implies that policy development is a dynamic and flexible process.
This is a stage at which an issue is identified as a policy need /problem.
This requires a collective participation of actors if government is to act on the policy need.
"The actors can range from technocrats to politician, researchers, community and or service consumers, interest groups (youth, women, and elderly) and external and internal SC performance Health Supply Chain policy issues or ideas may arise at any level along the supply chain system- upstream, midstream and lower stream to include national, sub-national and sector players, Traditional and Complimentary/Natural Medicines (TCM) stakeholders and general SC service delivery."
Identifying a policy need may be influenced by one or more of the following: Day-to-day practices and experiences.
"Health supply chain practitioners / technocrats/ policy implementers in their day-to-day routine activities interact with healthsupply chain actors, processes, and decisions which may reveal a gap that necessitates a policy action."
"Emerging practices from use of dietary supplements, lay/traditional herbal medicines, spiritual healing/anointing liquids, homeopathic medicines can also trigger a policy action."
Health supply chain scientific / applied studies as well as monitoring and evaluation performance studies usually make practice and policy recommendations that can trigger certain policy direction /action.
"Interest groups can identify loopholes in the existing policies and advocate for a new policy or policy reforms that can address their particular health supply chain interests (e.g women, youth, elderly, 5."
"Public / community perception: The community and general public perception of various issues and concerns may influence the actions topic area may not be mandated; however, the sensitivity and/or severity with which the public perceives these topics may warrant a 6."
"Laws, Acts, Regulations: Compliance with laws and regulations is a crucial component of policy development and risk management for the organization."
"Global and regional supply chain experiences and trends can influence certain home country policy actions in line with international In order to establish precedent and inform the policy process, research must be conducted into existing internal policies or similar external examples."
This ensures that problems can be identified early on in the process and improve the quality of the final document.
"These may include DPNM staff, social workers, independent researchers / Research consultants, NGOs, International agencies and Development partners."
There are two categories of research that are of particular importance in the development and implementation of policies in the health supply chain system.
"Operational research is aimed at better understanding of factors affecting medicines management, and identifying the best methods of selecting, procuring, distributing and using EMHS."
"Its results help to identify and implement practical and cost-effective measures, and should underpin management decisions."
Consultations should be undertaken early on in the process whilst ideas are being formulated and before decisions on options have been taken.
A detailed stakeholder mapping and analysis is necessary to establish who to consult.
"This can be in form a problem statement, summary sheet of findings of the"
"The consultations can be in form of inter-personal face-to-face interaction, organized meetings either physical or virtual, key informant interviews and even structured questionnaires."
"Potentially if the government is not acting, what should be likely effect?"
Policy drafting This is the stage of developing the policy content after getting a green light from the consulted stakeholders on the strategic direction.
It is a collaborative and iterative activity but also technical.
Focus is placed on the Mo.
The process of drafting the policy may involve benchmarking of the experiences and practices from other sister ministries or other governments that have had previous experience of developing a similar or related policy.
It may also involve the use of a consultant or involving subject matter experts to take the lead in the drafting of the policy.
"Usually, a policy drafting taskforce is also constituted to provide oversight of the consultants TOR and shaping the Timelines for content confirmation and validation of a draft policy is influenced by operational needs (e.g."
"They guide the organizations operations and set out the expectations for its employees, medical and other professional staff, volunteers, students, contracted providers, and individuals who act on behalf of, or in conjunction with the Policies may be developed to address a patient safety, and focus on a systematic and integrated approach to ensure a high standard receive care and services, and set out the responsibilities and expectations for the health care and associated professional teams in the delivery of Corporate Policies: Within the the strategic business direction of the organization and the operation of non- such as human resources, financial management, expectations of conduct, and resource allocation and management."
"The focus of corporate policies is on corporate accountability, financial stewardship, procurement, human resources, and asset management to promote risk management strategies, to ensure legislative and legal compliance, and to establish sound business practices."
Strategic stakeholder mapping is necessary to identify the most relevant and influential stakeholders to engage in the policy development process particularly those that are outside the technical highly intensively engaging so as to obtain views from a wider spectrum of stakeholders.
"Policy engagement provides an opportunity for public policy debate where various dimensions and aspects of policy problem is extensively discussed on several fora both informally and formally, face-to-face or virtually by key / strategic stakeholders."
"The fora can be task force meetings, stakeholder consultative meetings, among others."
The final version of the policy has to be submitted to multistage approving authorities.
Policy approval process Public policy is not implemented until it is duly approved by relevant authorities at different levels.
"Policy approval is essentially a multi-stage process and it is imperative that these approval stages are clearly mapped out in line with the long term institutional arrangement (LTIA) framework that is also consistent with the Guidelines for Governance and Management The first approval is at the staff feel confident that after all the consultations and engagements are done with key stakeholders, the draft policy in the current form is good enough and it should proceed to the next level of approval- the Senior Management level."
"The draft policy is presented to a relevant technical working Group (TWG) meeting e.g Medicines Procurement and Management (MPM), Governance, Standards, Policy and Regulations (GOSPOR) etc for further scrutiny and advice."
The draft policy is further presented to the Senior Management for scrutiny and discussion.
"At this level, several other observations are made that require changes in the first draft."
"This is a forum for the Government, Health Development Partners (HDPs) and other stakeholders established to receive and discuss health policy and to advise on the implementation of the policies."
"HPAC may also make someobservations on the draft policy document, proposes changes and recommendations moving forward."
"Once these changes are made in the draft policy to the satisfaction of the HPAC, members endorse the policy in its current form and recommends it for the next level of approval- Top Management."
The Top Management is the highest level organ in the responsible for policy decisions.
It critically reviews the provisions of the draft policy and may also propose changes to the draft policy.
"Again, once the proposed changes are made in the draft policy to the satisfaction of the Top Policy Management, the latter approves the policy."
"In case of any controversial issues in the draft policy, the Top Management may refer the draft policy to the Senior Top Management for discussion and once it is addressed, the policy can be finally approved at thatlevel."
It is imperative to note that some policies may require parliamentary and cabinet approvals depending on their sensitivity to public safety as well as public expenditure.
"In parliament, the draft policy is presented to the responsible Parliamentary committee for further scrutiny (such as Parliamentary Health) and it is subsequently discussed at the floor of Parliament by the members of parliament."
"Once the Parliament approves the policy, it is forwarded to Cabinet for final approval."
Cabinet has three options to consider in passage of the policy;
If existing policies and legislative framework are sufficient to address the issues in the policy proposals  Cabinet may decide to do nothing and therefore dismiss the policy.
The Cabinet may decide that the proposals made in the policy feed into already existing policy frameworks and can be improved to cover aspects The Cabinet may maintain the status quo and instead enhance on-going implementation of the existing policies and strengthen the aspects related to the subject matter of the proposed policy and other strategies without necessarily having a new policy in The Cabinet may decide to adopt the policy and implement the proposal in the policy under a new policy framework.
Lobby and influence the meeting agendas to have the draft policy discussed at the successive approvalstages.
Prepare to submit all the supporting documents that may be required during the policy 3.5.3.
"Policy Implementation Upon the approval, a public policy is implemented according to its implementation strategy."
One critical aspect of policy implementation is dissemination to the general public for purposes of publicity and ensuring a high degree of conversance among the policy implementers.
"At this stage, policy decisions lead to specific actions at the level of programs and projects, policy ideas are translated into proper projects intended to achieve policy valued objectives, strategies are developed to implement these programs and projects."
Public policy actions lead to defined outcomes that are tangible and measurable.
"At this stage, policy impact begins to be visible, but also unintended consequences of public policy can be analyzed."
Policy Monitoring and Evaluation Policy monitoring seeks to establish whether provisions and associated programs and projects are implemented so as to achieve the stated goal and objectives.
It involves determining whether or not the observed events are consistent with the policy provisions and planned activities.
It is a checking process to correct weaknesses during the implementation.
"Policy monitoring helps to exercise provision and control and from this process, it can be identified that the policy is not going according to plan or it appears the policy is not on course to achieve its targets."
This helps policy managers to review if implementation of strategies are achieving intended outcomes to inform appropriate modification and establish a new plan on which right actions can be taken.
"There are also three important issues must be considered during policy monitoring The involvement of relevant actors who are key to consult in policy Recognizing differences in attitudes, competencies, intelligence, personality during data collection."
It is done throughout the policy implementation Impact monitoring  this provides information on the progress of the policy implementation at given points in time.
Policy evaluation ascertains whether ornot;The intended policy goals and objectives have been achieved; The policy implementation process has been cost effective; The policy problems and the implementation strategies were identified correctly; The policy outcomes have generated other host of problems that require policy 3.7.2.
Policy evaluation Policy evaluation involves a comprehensive assessment of whether or not the policy has had any impact.
The interest is to match outcomes with the objectives.
"If the intended Health commodities and services have been produced to the public, then the policy is said to be effective; If Health commodities and services are delivered at a minimum cost, the policy is said to be efficient and effective; and If policy outcomes are delivered at a maximum cost, then the policy is likely to be a bad one and should therefore be reformed or abandoned."
Key issues to note in policy monitoring and evaluation Policy monitoring and evaluation are different activities with different purposes but are mutually reinforcing in the policy implementation process.
Policy is monitored to track its implementation progress and to establish whether or not it is on course in line with its goal and objectives.
While Policy is evaluated to establish whether it has achieved its intended goal and objectives.
"Policy monitoring is continuously conducted both formally and informally while policy evaluation is evaluated periodically and usually formal (e.g mid-term evaluation /impact monitoring, or end-line / summative evaluation)."
Policy monitoring and evaluation can be conducted by a designated technical person Policy M&Especialist or any other designated technical person in the Policy development focal person).
"Policy monitoring and evaluation data (report) is important to inform appropriate actions to be taken in the course of policy implementation as well as in the designing of new policies that are more effective, efficient, and responsive."
"Policy review and analysis Policy review and analysis is the activity involving studying, gathering, processing, ordering and presenting specific information for policy making."
Analysis is an important phase in policy making and it is essential for making critical policy decisions.
Policy analysis and review helps to inform policy makers on the implications of the options presented and enables them to know whether the existing policy is in tandem with the current national and international trends or whether it is still relevant in the ever changing circumstances.
"Policy evaluation, review and analyses provide sufficient data on the performance of existing policy to guide decisions and course of action regarding the policy in question."
This can either be making reforms in the existing policy or formulating a new policy that is more relevant to the prevailing circumstances.
Key issues to note in policy analysis and review Policy analysis and review is a deliberate and targeted activity towards a certain existing policy.
It is informed by data generated during monitoring and Policy analysis and review is a continuous activity in the policy cycle.
"However, as a targeted activity, it is conducted towards the end of the life of the policy or even after the implementation period."
Policy analysis and review is done in response to the emerging issues from monitoring and evaluation but importantly to respond to the current national and international trends.
Policy review and analysis can be conducted by a designated technical person Policy review and analysis specialist in the Policy Analysis designated technical person in the Policy review and analysis leads to the reforming of the existing policy or formulating 	 a new policy that is more relevant and responsive to the prevailing circumstances.
"In performing the task of supply chain policy analysis and review, the designated technical personnel who can critically analyze and review health policies on a continuous process."

"Re classification of antibiotics was developed by WHO in which antibiotics are classified into three different groups - Access, Watch and Reserve - based on their of their use promoting resistance to emphasize the importance of A specific group of people, usually living in a defined geographical area, who share common values, norms, culture, and customs, and are arranged in a social structure according to relationships which the community has collectively developed over a period."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Infections that are contracted outside of a within forty-eight hours of admission and without any previous health These include the Village Health Teams (VHTs) private sector composed of traditional and complementary medicine practitioners, private health professionals, the non-facility based non-governmental organizations who offer preventive, curative and rehabilitative health services, social enterprises offering subsidized health services and lay community workers who are the beneficiary targets by all the players The development of observable ability of a person (or individual health worker) that integrates knowledge, skills and attitudes in their performance of tasks."
"Competencies are durable, trainable and, through the expression of behavior, measurable."
Coordinated guidance and interventions to improve appropriate use of microbiological diagnostics to guide therapeutic decisions.
"The initial antimicrobial treatment administered based on judgment and knowledge of common pathogens associated with a particular infection, even before the specific causative organism knowledge of common pathogens, and local guidelines to select an antimicrobial agent or combination of agents that is likely to cover the most probable pathogens."
Health-careassociated infection/ An infection that occurs after a patient is admitted to a healthcare facility and that were not present or incubating at the time of admission.
An infection is usually defined as a HAI if it manifests more than forty-eight hours after admission to the healthcare facility.
Health-care- associated infections can also appear after discharge.
"The use of preventive measures, including medications or interventions, to reduce the risk of developing a particular disease or condition in individuals who are at high risk or have specific predisposing factors."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - These are the measures, direct or indirect that will verify to what extent the objectives have been fulfilled."
"The term objectively implies that if these should be specified in a way that is independent of possible Total number of bed days of all admitted patients accommodated during the reporting period, taken from a count of the number of Outcome measures/indicators are used in AMS activities to capture quantitative change in e.g., patient, or economic outcomes, but most of all in antibiotic use."
"Antibiotic consumption is expressed with a numerator indicating the quantity used (i.e., DDDs or DOTs) per defined denominator (i.e., patient-days, admissions, consultations), to enable comparisons over time in the same setting or with other settings."
Patient Days are the sum of the lengths of stays of each patient separated during the reporting period.
"An example in AMS would be the proportion of patients prescribed antibiotic treatment in compliance with standard treatment Measures that seek to avert the occurrence of disease, arrest its progress, and reduce its consequences once it is established."
"A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis (alternatively called a situational analysis) is a popular method of identifying internal and/or present strengths and weaknesses, and external and/or future opportunities and threats to aid a decisionmaking process."
"Structure refers to the characteristics (capacity, systems and processes) of the setting in which AMS programs are conducted."
"Structures may be material or human resources, such as availability of financial resources, number of personnel, availability of guidelines, availability of information technology tools, etc."
"The problem of antimicrobial resistance in infectious agents has been rising, and there is global concern that in the absence of interventions to reverse these trends, the means to treat infectious diseases will be limited and out-of-reach for many, especially those living in low- and middle Pathogen resistance to antimicrobials is a natural phenomenon that has been observed since the first antibiotics were discovered."
AMR has increased in recent years with the growing global population and concordant increase in the use of antimicrobials.
This has exerted selection pressure on microbes and resulted in increased populations of antimicrobial resistant strains of pathogenic organisms.
"Unfortunately, the upward trend of AMR has not been matched by the development of new antimicrobial agents to treat the emerging resistant pathogens 2."
"The consequences of infection with antimicrobial-resistant organisms can be severe leading to increased mortality, morbidity, and economic depreciation due to loss of productivity."
This was followed by a political declaration by the high level meeting of the general assembly on AMR in 4.
"In this context, the problem of AMR is pronounced further by the substantial economic burden and effect on the national health systems through prolonged stays in the need for more expensive drugs, and the greater need for intensive care treatment."
"In 2021, the average daily defined doses (DDDs) per 1000 inhabitants was 29.02 for all antimicrobials; 80.7% of antimicrobials consumed were oral."
"Between and 2021, 62.19% of the total volume of antibiotics imported was in the Access category of the WHO AWa."
"Re classification, while 14.5% were in the Watch category."
Azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were the most consumed Watch antibiotics in 2021.
The consumption of antibiotics at facility level is driven by the high use of antibiotics among outpatients and inpatients.
Published and anecdotal data indicate that between 60-74% of admitted patients are on one or more systemic antibiotics.
The adherence to the national treatment guidelines and use of microbiology test results is low.
"However, the system to manage and support community health workers has not been well established leading to fragmented geographic coverage, inconsistent functionality, and intermittent assistance from external partners."
There is documented evidence that patients will use antibiotics before a doctor .
"This self-medicated use of antibiotics is enabled by the ease of access to these medicines in drug shops and pharmacies despite the prevailing law  requiring a prescription from a Recognizing the importance of community health and the need to address its related challenges, the period of 2021/22-2025/26."
This strategy is anchored in the Parish Development Model as well as other national frameworks.
It is also intended to ensure that health services are accessible and that a person-centered approach in the provision of healthcare is implemented to achieve significant impact in the short and long term.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Good infection prevention and control (IPC) is proposed as a key intervention against the spread of resistant pathogens within the facility and limits the use/exposure to antibiotics.
Evidence has shown that effective hand hygiene practices reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) by 50% while effective infection prevention and control reduce healthcareassociated infections by at least 30% (WHO).
"However, compliance with this practice among healthcare workers is low."
"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the commonest cause of HAIs, has been isolated from the hands of more than half of healthcare workers."
Hand hygiene may help in the control of nosocomial infections .
"In line with the NAP documented approaches for implementing AMS programs nationwide, it is crucial to emphasize increasing capacity for surveillance of resistant bacteria and monitoring volumes of antibiotics consumed alongside conducting awareness campaigns among health workers (Dr Adrian JBrink et al., 2016, Mera A. Ababneh et al., 2021)."
"They also provide a rational basis for an efficient procurement and supply system that ensures the availability of safe, efficacious, quality medicines and health supplies."
"Re classification of antibiotics was developed by WHO in which antibiotics are classified into three different groups - Access, Watch, and Reserve the importance of their appropriate use ."
"Currently, all antibiotics in common are now classified using the AWa."
The details of which antibiotics belong to each category can be found in Annex 1.
This group includes antibiotics that have activity against a wide range of commonly encountered susceptible pathogens while also showing lower resistance potential than antibiotics in the other groups.
Selected Access group antibiotics are recommended as essential first or second-choice empiric treatment options for infectious syndromes reviewed by the EML Expert Committee and are listed as individual medicines on the Model Lists of Essential Medicines to improve access and promote appropriate This group includes antibiotic classes that have higher resistance potential and includes most of the highest priority agents among the Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine and/or antibiotics that are at relatively high risk of selection of bacterial resistance.
These medicines should be prioritized as key targets of stewardship programs and monitoring.
Selected Watch group antibiotics are recommended as essential first or second-choice empiric treatment options for a limited number of specific infectious syndromes.
This group includes antibiotics and antibiotic classes that should be reserved for treatment of confirmed or suspected infections due to multi-drug-resistant organisms.
Reserve group antibiotics should be treated as last resort options.
"These antibiotics should be accessible, but their use should be tailored to highly specific patients and settings, when all alternatives have failed or are These medicines should be protected and prioritized as key targets of national and international stewardship programs involving monitoring and utilization reporting, to preserve their effectiveness."
"Prevent antimicrobial overuse, misuse and abuse, and development of antimicrobial resistance by ensuring that antibiotic prescribing is evidence-based and indicated."
This ensures that those who do not need antibiotics do not have them and that those who need them do not use them indiscriminately.
"This manual is a concise guide for national actors, healthcare facility managers and their AMS teams, and community health workers on how to establish, implement, monitor and evaluate AMS programs in their institutions, including study tools for assessing progress and performance."
The purpose of this manual is to enable optimal use of antimicrobials to improve the management of infectious diseases and improve patient outcomes.
"This manual is developed to; Support policymakers, health workers, and the community to develop mechanisms for the optimization of antimicrobial use."
"Guide on the composition and provide terms of reference for the governance of  Antimicrobial The focus of this manual is to guide policymakers, health workers, and the community on a system approach to establishing and implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) that promote the prudent use of antimicrobials."

"At sub-national level, AMS activities in human health are implemented at the health facility and the community level."
"At the Health facility level, AMS activities are coordinated through the Medicines"
The AMS agenda is driven by the AMS subcommittee under the stewardship of the MTC.
All health facilities from Health Center III and above should have functional Medicines and Therapeutics committees irrespective of ownership.
The secretariat shall ensure that meetings are held at least quarterly.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Role of the Advisory Committee on Appropriate Medicines Use The overall goal of the Advisory Committee on AMU is to promote the availability and appropriate use of medicines and health supplies in the private and public sectors.
The National AMS subcommittee shall have a secretariat whose role will be the coordination and facilitation of the activities of the subcommittee.
"A representative from Implementing Partners for AMS The National AMS subcommittee shall have a secretariat which will consist of a group of selected individuals from the Division of Quality Assurance, NHLDS, health implementing partners and shall comprise at most 5 people."
The secretariate will ensure that meetings are held at least 6 times annually.
"Role of the National AMS subcommittee Coordinates Collection and analysis of information used to develop policies concerning optimal use of antimicrobial at health facility and community level Propose national targets to monitor AMS implementation Monitor and evaluate consumption and use of antimicrobials Coordinate mechanism to create awareness for AMR including activities during WAAW, developing IEC materials etc spread of resistant microorganism."
"At the health facility level, AMR containment is led by the Medicines and Therapeutics Committee (MTC)."
The MTC is supported by an AMS sub-committee for AMRrelated activities.
"The IPC and Continuous Quality Improvement committees are two additional committees that closely collaborate with MTC and together they submit relevant information to At the national level, MOH coordinates AMR efforts through its have respective national committees that receive and analyse AMR-related data from health facilities."
"The members should include the following but not limited to: staff (preferably microbiologist), nurse, community health focal (CHD) person, epidemiologist, data informant, and a representative from the IPC committee (IPC focal person)."
"The AMS subcommittee should be a small but agile team that will work within the MTC and the wider Quality Improvement framework to promote the antimicrobial stewardship agenda as per The AMS subcommittee will coordinate and facilitate activities that will include but not be limited to AMR surveillance, diagnostic stewardship, AMU/Cmonitoring, IPC, and other activities related to AMS."
The MOH recommends that each subcommittee should meet at least six times a year.
The composition of the AMS subcommittee should involve all healthcare workers under the 3 key areas mentioned above.
H recommends that the AMS committee chairperson and the secretary should be members of the MTC.
Policies should specifically include sections on methods to limit and restrict use of antimicrobials in the health facility and primary care Monitor and assess consumption and use through prescribing quality assurance programs and medicine use evaluations to ensure use of effective antimicrobials of adequate quality Participate in the educational programs for health-care staff.
Antimicrobial stewardship team This is a team of committed and agile members of the health facility from different service points.
The team leader of AMS team should be a member of AMS subcommittee.
Reporting and feedback to AMS committee or other executive groups 2.2.3 Leadership and governance of AMS in a National Referral and specialized health facilities The implementation of AMS in this category of health facilities is complex given the structural arrangement.
H recommends that the MTCs for these institutions is constituted at directorate level.
"The MOH recommends that such mechanisms meet and report to to AMS and AMR national sub-committees and for the alert organisms, these should be reported immediately as soon as they are identified as per Mo."
"It may include health workers from AMR surveillance, diagnostic stewardship, AMU&Cand IPC."
The number may vary as per the level of care depending on the number of operational units/wards.
"The surveillance data should be reported quarterly to AMS and AMR national sub-committees and for the alert organisms, these should be reported immediately as soon as they are identified as"
"The private health service providers will include the private drug outlets (pharmacies and Drug shops), the private The Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) are mandated to optimise antimicrobial consumption and use through consultations, recommendations of the use of the relevant treatment guidelines e.g Integrated Community Case Management (i. CCM) , promoting awareness about antimicrobial consumption and use under the supervision of their respective health facilities."
"The private drug outlets are mandated to optimise antimicrobial consumption and use  through, consultations, recommendations of the use of the relevant treatment guidelines, promoting patients referral and  awareness about antimicrobial resistance."
The dispensing of antimicrobials should be done on valid prescription only.
Drug outlets should source their supplies from licensed rational prescribing.
They should observe referral system.
"The consumers include the patients, and the general public who are involved directly or indirectly in the consumption and use of antimicrobials."
"Their major role is to adhere to treatment, seek medical care from licensed health service providers, report and promote rational use of antimicrobials by alerting the prescribers at different points of care and any other relevant regulatory authorities on any possible irrational use of antimicrobials."
"Secondly, the community through their local leaders, CHEWs and community-based organisations shall advocate for proper use of antimicrobials and propose relevant actions to be adopted by the community leadership to improve AMS in the community."
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Underutilization and incorrect use of microbiological tests and diagnostic tools can have a negative effect on the management and outcome for individual patients.
AMR surveillance and AMS programs are inherently intertwined.
"AMR surveillance should provide critical data that: Informs selection of antimicrobials, Identifies emerging resistance, Monitors the effectiveness of stewardship interventions."
"Conversely, the AMS subcommittee should utilize surveillance data to guide/inform antimicrobial prescriptions, target interventions, and assess their impact."
"The collaboration between the AMR surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship is essential for optimizing antimicrobial use, reducing AMR rates, and preserving the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents for future use."
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - 3.3 Diagnostic Stewardship (DS) Diagnostic stewardship refers to coordinated guidance and interventions to improve appropriate use of microbiological diagnostics to guide therapeutic decisions.
"It should promote timely, appropriate, diagnostic testing, including specimen collection, and pathogen identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, accurate, and timely reporting of results to guide patient treatment."
It is optimally combined with antimicrobial stewardship to allow for the right interpretation to translate into the right antimicrobial at the right time.
"However, to achieve this, good laboratory practices and affordable access to laboratories with quality management systems, as well as the capacity and capability to perform timely and reliable microbiological diagnostics are essential."
"Therefore, the AMS subcommittee is responsible for implementing diagnostic stewardship at 3.3.1 Objectives of Diagnostic Stewardship The main objective of microbiological diagnostic stewardship is to enable: Patient management guided by timely microbiological data to deliver safer more effective and efficient patient care."
Specimen collection should take place before initiating any empiric treatment (Initial treatment targeted at the most probable causative microorganism).
"The recommendations should be based on local susceptibility data (facility antibiogram), national treatment guidelines like the 2."
"Participation in local surveillance data management for: Routinely provide information that requires action and decision-making at the national 3.3.4.1 Role of the AMS subcommittee in diagnostic stewardship Ensure appropriate compilation and analysis of patient and microbiological data, To enhance diagnostic stewardship within the facility Ensure dissemination of compiled and analyzed AMR results and antibiograms to all healthcare Ensure that AMR reports are transmitted to staff responsible for developing treatment Ensure transmission of regular reports and alerts to the national AMR surveillance coordinating center and the national AMS committee, through the Medicines and Therapeutic Committee."
"Ensure appropriate transportation or, appropriate storage while awaiting transportation to the 3.3.6 Role of Laboratory Staff in Diagnostic Stewardship The designated laboratory staff is responsible for specimen collection where needed, training other health workers in appropriate sample collection, oversee the sample collection processes at the facility level, and provide guidance on sample packaging, storage, and transportation."
Increase in specimens submitted to the laboratory according Good laboratory practices in place resulting in reliable and Patient treatment and surveillance actions are informed in a
Accurate and representative AMR surveillance data to inform treatment guidelines and AMR control strategies 3.4 Developing an Antibiogram An antibiogram is an aggregated profile of antimicrobial susceptibility testing data of a specific microorganism to a set of antimicrobials.
The antibiogram is an essential resource for facilities to track changes in antimicrobial resistance and to guide empirical antimicrobial treatment.
Antibiograms can also be used to perform surveillance for the emergence of drug-resistant organisms and identify areas for intervention by antimicrobial stewardship programs and training needs.
An antibiogram is developed from specific information about the facilitys microbiology cultures.
You can potentially obtain these data from several different sources.
What data are needed to create the antibiogram?
"The antibiogram should enable the categorization of patient characteristics, thereby providing completeness of laboratory/microbiology data collection tools is critical."
These data elements Patient ID: patient number Setting where sample was collected e.g.
Health facility antibiograms should be reviewed annually.
Antibiotic susceptibility data should include the
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Number of pathogens identified Proportion of pathogens that are susceptible to each tested drug The antibiogram should only include pathogen species for which there are 30 or more isolates.
"If the data available includes organisms with fewer than 30 isolates, you should determine if it is essential to include the species."
"If they are, you should include a note to indicate less statistical validity of the estimates of percentage susceptibility (%S)."
The factors that can affect cumulative antibiogram data include: Patient population served.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - The first column lists the organisms that were included; these may be separated by Grampositive and Gram-negative results.
"The remaining columns of the antibiogram are the antibiotics that were tested, and the organisms susceptibilities are presented as a percentage of the total number of isolates."
A patient may be cultured multiple times in a year and their results consistently reveal Staphylococcus aureus.
The antibiogram should only be used as a general guide for empirical antimicrobial therapy until the specific antimicrobial susceptibility test results for a particular patient become available.
"A patients particular infection history, including past antimicrobial use, must also be A cumulative antibiogram may provide the basis for selection of empirical antimicrobial treatments for specific infections before the patients antimicrobial susceptibility results become available."
"If you have a small number of cultures represented in your antibiogram, updating your antibiogram once a year may be sufficient."
Peripheral Health facilities not performing culture and sensitivity should use the sample referral system for obtaining such tests to be able obtain AMR surveillance data for their facilities.
The chair for the facility AMS subcommittee is responsible for ensuring the availability and access to the facility antibiogram.
The different metrics of measuring consumption as well as assessing use are also described.
Irrational use of Antimicrobials is a modifiable risk factor for antimicrobial resistance.
Optimal use of antimicrobials is important at all levels of care within the country and will go a long way in addressing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AMCU data can be used to provide baseline information to evaluate AMS interventions.
To identify challenges relating to changes in antimicrobial exposure and utilization to develop 3.
"One of the key assumptions for AMC data is that all that is imported is consumed locally and all that is distributed, sold, or issued from health facility stores is consumed; thus, it serves as a proxy estimate of the use of antimicrobials."
National/Centralized distributors Centralized level warehouse distribution records can also provide aggregated data of antimicrobial consumption that act as a proxy for use to the health facilities or institutions that they serve.
"The consumption can be disaggregated or stratified by region/geographical location, by health facility level of care, by public or private sectors, and again by population-level metrics using the population estimates of the regions supplied."
Data collection at the national level is done annually by collaboration between the NDA and the portal.
The data collection methodology is based on the WHO GLASS Manual on management of Antimicrobial consumption data .
"The data may be aggregated at the store level to represent the total consumption for the facility, or disaggregated by antimicrobial The data collection method is based on the WHO Methodology for AMC surveillance in (version 2019)."
"It uses the ATC/DDD methodology to calculate consumption, and an MS. Excel template is available and instructions for filling it are provided in WHO guidance on surveillance of antimicrobial consumption in 4.1.3 Reporting metrics for AMC data Antimicrobial consumption is measured using aggregate data of all antimicrobials consumed in a given period using a common system of nomenclature and standardized methodology."
"The most commonly used system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, and the most commonly used measurement metric is the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)."
DDDs are assigned to different antibiotics based on their pharmacological properties and recommended daily dosages.
"This may relate to programs such as HIV, TB, and malaria or to special populations such as migrants and refugees."
"For example 10 DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day can be interpreted as a representative group of 1000 inhabitants, 10 DDDs of the drug are utilized on average, on any given day of the year analysed."
"Alternatively, this can be expressed as 10/1000 (1%) of the population are receiving this drug each day in that year."
This estimate is most useful for drugs used chronically and when there is good agreement between the average prescribed daily dose (PDD) and the DDD.
"It estimates the facility's antimicrobial consumption by patient load It is calculated by dividing the total number of DDDs consumed over a given period by the number of bed days in the same period, multiplied by 100."
The number of bed days refers to the total number of days that beds in a healthcare facility are occupied by patients during a specific time frame.
"To calculate DDDs per patient, the total number of DDDs consumed within a defined period is divided by the total number of individual patients who received antibiotics during the same period."
"By comparing DDDs per patient over time or across different settings, healthcare providers can identify patterns, trends, or deviations from established guidelines."
Antibiotic use (AMU) is derived from individual patient data and may include information on patient characteristics and indications for treatment.
Measurement of antimicrobial use at facility and community levels is critical to understanding the prevailing trends of antimicrobial use and providing context to the emergence of AMR.
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Antibiotics are prescribed when not needed, e.g."
Antibiotics are prescribed by the wrong route: IV vs oral Duration of antibiotic treatment should be optimized (e.g.
"Repeat doses are not administered in a timely way, which is critical in the case of septic shock and other serious infections."
"Conducting a PPS is more resource-intensive than collecting antimicrobial consumption data, as data is collected on individual patients, and requires more human resources."
This additional effort is important for antimicrobial stewardship interventions geared towards achieving optimal use of antimicrobials.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Details of the methods of collection data for point prevalence surveys are clearly outlined in the National Guidelines for Antimicrobial Consumption and Use Surveillance in Human Health and the WHO Methodology for Point Prevalence Survey on Antibiotic Use In for the PPS Tool.
The data generated from a PPS is fed into the national database at the Mo.
H which provides a dashboard where facilities can access their performance and design necessary A uniform methodology to survey antimicrobial prescribing in and facilitates comparisons of antimicrobial use over time and between 4.2.1.2 WHO/INRUD Drug indicator surveys for Out patients Data on antimicrobial use at the OPD shall be collected using the WHO/INRUD drug indicator survey (DIS) and the OPD antibiotic survey adapted from the Therapeutics Committee manual 2018.
OPD Register is the data source.
"During this analysis, in addition to the patient prescription and laboratory records, information on Prospective drug use evaluations are easier to conduct and will yield good evidence since data will be collected with the objectives of the study in mind."
Antimicrobial use evaluations can be conducted at facility level to further understand the factors associated with the use of a particular drug.
The findings of these studies can then be used to put in place strategies to address overuse/or any form of misuse.
They are used to assess for compliance of antibiotic prescription and administration in accordance with guidelines or protocols.
"The evaluation can identify any deviations related to overuse, underuse or misuse, identify areas for quality improvement as well as monitoring treatment outcomes."
The evaluation can be done prospectively through direct observation or retrospectively through 4.2.1.5 Triggers for medicine use evaluation or a prescription audit.
The need for audit or evaluation can be triggered in two ways.
"This data can be collected on ward rounds or directly from patients medical charts, or from outpatient prescriptions and registers."
"When a problem is detected, for example, an increase in infections after surgery or in urine cultures referred to the microbiology lab which might indicate that patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria are wrongly being treated for UTIs."
Antibiotics where consumption has increased significantly over time.
A prospective evaluation should be prioritized over a retrospective evaluation because it provides a current description of antibiotic use practices that is more relevant and useful to the Prospective evaluations can be performed alongside recommendations for changes in antibiotic treatment in real-time.
Feedback can be delivered to groups e.g.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - visual summaries of the quantitative and qualitative findings; synthesized areas of improvement and recommendations can be delivered in presentations or as posters.
The recommendations should include specific actions that are within the recipients control to Include benchmarks or achievable targets for comparisons within the facility for antibiotic prescribing that are indicator specific and based on national and/or local performance data of high performing peers.
The information should be displayed such that recipients can understand their performance and desired actions within seconds.
"Individual-level antibiotic feedback should be delivered confidentially to the prescribers, and create the opportunity for peer discussion."
"AMS Programmes and IPC Programmes have similar goals, strategies, and metrics, and an integrated model can benefit both programs."
The end results are reduced patients contributing to a reduction in mortality and morbidity hence improved public health.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - AMS and IPC programme interrelationship can be understood as follows: Prevention of spread of Infections: Infection prevention measures are crucial for reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections.
"By implementing strategies such as hand hygiene, proper disinfection, and environmental cleaning, the risk of infections can be minimized."
"This, in turn, can reduce the need for antimicrobial treatment."
"When infections are prevented through robust infection prevention practices, the overall burden of infections decreases, resulting in a reduced need for antimicrobial treatment."
"By preventing infections in the community and within the health facility, hence the need for antimicrobial treatment is Collaborative Efforts: Effective collaboration between antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention teams is vital to achieve optimal patient outcomes and reduce the transmission of infections."
Coordinated efforts ensure that infection prevention measures and antimicrobial prescribing practices are aligned and reinforce each other.
Various IPC measures shall be used to improve AMS programs as shown in Antimicrobial Stewardship Optimise antimicrobial use Reduce emergence of antibiotic Infection Prevention Programs infection (HAIs) transmission Improve patient treatment Reduce cost of health care
"Hand hygiene is a fundamental infection prevention measure that reduces the transmission of pathogens, thereby decreasing the need for antimicrobial treatment."
Proper utilization of PPE can reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections and subsequently decrease the need for antimicrobial therapy.
Risk assessment and management: Notify and isolate patients with identified resistant pathogens and those with highly infectious organisms from the rest of the ward for specialized Encourage health workers to remove indwelling devices from patients that are no longer needed e.g.
Feedback on infection prevention practices and the impact of reducing antimicrobial use can help guide targeted interventions.
Collaborative assessments provide a comprehensive understanding of areas for improvement and allow for coordinated action plans to enhance both infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship efforts.
The IPC and AMS programs should make decisions and undertake joint interventions to address the identified gaps for better patient Education and Training for support staff and training Comprehensive Training Programs: Develop comprehensive educational programs that integrate both infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship principles.
The patients should be empowered to remind health workers to perform hand hygiene before any procedure is On job refresher training for support staff/Cleaners (also known as environmental cleaning staff or environmental services There should be routine refresher training for support staff on IPC practices and their roles and impart in combatting HAI should be
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - 5.3 Targeted care bundles These are a set of evidence-based practices designed to prevent specific healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) or improve patient outcomes.
Care bundles are a systematic approach that combines several interventions or measures into a cohesive package to ensure comprehensive and standardized care delivery.
"Targeted care bundles are specifically developed to address a particular type of infection, such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), or other healthcare-associated infections."
"These bundles are typically based on best practices and Each targeted care bundle consists of a set of interventions that, when implemented together, have been shown to effectively reduce the risk of infection or improve patient outcomes."
Several specific bundles are available that can be implemented at healthcare facilities in resourcelimited settings.
"These packages of care contribute to infection prevention, reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, and may limit the spread and development of antibiotic resistance in 5.4 Environmental swabbing."
"Routine random/undirected environmental sampling/swabbing is not recommended unless the rate of health care associated infections have been associated with levels of general microbial environmental contamination, research, quality assurance, to confirm the presence of hazardous chemical or biological agent and other targeted interventions."
These systems should facilitate collaboration between infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship teams to analyse and interpret data Performance Metrics and Indicators: Develop performance metrics and indicators that measure both infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship outcomes.
"This can include indicators such as hand hygiene compliance rates, adherence to appropriate antimicrobial prescribing guidelines, and rates of healthcareassociated infections."
"Supply chain refers to the set of procedures to ensure that pharmaceuticals and health supplies reach the final consumer (patient) or the healthcare worker at the right time and place, in the right quality and quantity, and at an appropriate cost and level of effectiveness The link between AMS and Supply chain management The aim of supply chain management for AMS is to ensure that safe, effective and quality antimicrobials and health supplies are available and accessible at all times."
"This ensures that HCWs are able to use appropriate laboratory and diagnostic tools, and prescribe the most appropriate antimicrobials, and the right health supplies are available for effective infection prevention and control, which is essential for AMS."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Shortage of appropriate, safe and effective antimicrobials may lead to use of less effective alternatives, which is a major driver for development of AMR."
"In addition, ineffective supply chain management may also limit availability of relevant laboratory and diagnostic supplies, thereby encouraging empirical prescribing of antimicrobials, another key driver of AMR."
The following tools and criteria should guide the selection process for antimicrobials Quantification is the process of estimating how much of the specific EMHS is needed for procurement for a specific period to ensure an uninterrupted supply.
"However, it is possible to arrange for special imports for items not on the National Drug register."
"Re classification of ALL categories of antibiotics shall be included depending on the level of care while prioritizing antibiotics in the ACCESS category >60% of all antibiotics), Product catalogues e.g., NMS Check product catalogs as these provide the available range of products and dosage forms for selection e.g., which antimicrobials are in cream, ointment or suspension, or management guidelines, and other institutional guidelines."
"This data can be obtained from records such as stock cards, stock books, or electronic logistics management information systems (e. LMIS)."
"To enhance accuracy and reliability,  the data should be complete, accurate, and properly adjusted for stockouts and anticipated changes in demand and use."
"Used to estimate consumption of antimicrobials, laboratory, and health supplies by using medicine consumption, demand, or use and/or pharmaceutical expenditure for different facilities to extrapolate to a similar or related health facility taking into consideration the population coverage or service This can work for new facilities where morbidity or prior consumption data are not available."
"In other words, the service performance (e.g., consumption of a particular commodity) in one facility is used to project needs of a facility with similar level of care, whose data is not available at the time of quantification exercise."
"At both national and sub-national levels, there should be mechanisms to monitor consumption patterns, shelf life and implementation of effective inventory management systems to support You can quantify antimicrobials and laboratory supplies  using one or a combination of the More details on use of these different quantification methods can be found in the EMHS Management Procurement of antimicrobials and laboratory supplies involves all decisions and actions in costing and purchasing/procuring the selected commodities, in line with the available resources."
"At the facility level, this process should follow quantification, which generates a requirement list showing the quantities of the different commodities needed for a specified period."
"Next, the facility should cost this requirement list by multiplying these quantities with the estimated unit prices of these commodities."
The prices can be obtained from supplier catalogs or recent invoices.
"The resulting list, called the costed non-vetted requirement list or wish list is crucial for documenting the actual commodity and financial needs of the facility."
"The AMS committee can work with the supply chain committee, or work with the MTC to assign staff with expertise in the area if there is no supply chain committee, to quantify and develop a wish list for antimicrobials and health supplies relevant for AMS alongside other Prior to the development of a procurement plan, the MTC should convene an entry meeting with various facility stakeholders to discuss or review the quantification process, tools for data collection, review period, and the budget allocated."
"When developing the final procurement plan, the MTC should use the tools below to ensure the review process is as objective and cost-effective as possible."
Vital (V) commodities take top priority while necessary (N) commodities take the lowest priority and can be entirely eliminated if the budget is constrained.
"When the budget is so limited that even the Vitems must be reduced, this should be done with the consensus of the MTC members."
This helps to assess whether the plan is representative of the priorities of the facility.
This can be used to identify items that account for the highest costs and/or high use when considering ways to reduce procurement costs.
"Re classification to monitor and apportion expenditure on antimicrobials to keep it within the recommended ranges, e.g., at least 60% of the expenditure on antibiotics should go to drugs in the ACCESS category."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - 6.2.4 Distribution and storage of antimicrobials and laboratory supplies The health facility should enter all supplies received from the warehouse or other sources  into the appropriate HMIS tool e.g., Stock cards and or any e-LMIS."
"The facility should also store copies of proof of delivery records that accompany these supplies, such as delivery notes/goods received notes (GRNs) and invoices."
Movement of stock from the health facility store to the user units  should be recorded on  approved requisition and issue vouchers (manual  or electronic).
"At the user units, health workers should record all dispensed medicines in  the correct dispensing logs or electronic system."
"In the community, drug outlets like pharmacies must have systems in place to record supplies they receive from wholesalers/suppliers and sell to customers, both individuals and retailers."
"Recording the distribution of antimicrobials is a key component of AMS as it ensures traceability and accountability, and provides complete data needed for analysis."
"MTCs and/or AMS committees at health facilities must invest sufficient energy in ensuring that distribution of antimicrobials within the health facility is recorded consistently, completely, and accurately."
The staff dispensing should be qualified and trained.
"The dispensing process is composed of 6 steps; Receiving and validation of the prescription, 2."
Dispensing procedures to ensure antimicrobial stewardship Extra caution should be taken for prescriptions with antimicrobials in order to ensure antimicrobial
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Review of prescriptions to ensure that they are appropriate and in line with the national guidelines on the use of antimicrobials , ."
Patients should be educated on antimicrobial resistance and infection prevention measures.
The link between laboratory supplies and antimicrobial stewardship emphasizes the critical importance of ensuring that laboratories have access to sufficient and reliable tools and resources to support effective management of infectious diseases.
Test Appropriateness: Ensure that the selection of tests aligns with the tests and avoid unnecessary or redundant testing that may waste supplies and resources.
"Ensure that samples are collected at the right time, e.g., before initiation of empiric treatment and at the time of fever spikes in the case of blood cultures."
This helps prevent false-positive or false-negative results and misdiagnosis that may lead to repeat testing and inappropriate prescriptions.
"These protocols provide clear instructions on the appropriate use of supplies, including culture media, antimicrobial discs, reference strains reagents, etc."
Ensure that staff are trained and adhere to these protocols to maintain consistency and avoid
"Effective communication ensures that testing is aligned with patient needs, reducing unnecessary testing and supply consumption."
"A procurement planning team should include a user In facilities with an MTC, the committee should lead the procurement planning process."
The MTC may co-opt additional members to support the process where necessary to provide technical guidance during the procurement planning process.
This can be achieved through quality improvement methods and current evidencebased knowledge regarding the appropriate use of antimicrobials.
Training on AMS principles is essential to causing positive behavioral change .
"These are more effective than passive education (CDC, 2019; Majumder et al., 2020)."
"This is because active education promotes interaction and active participation, especially among healthcare workers."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - 7.3 Essential AMS Competencies To enable AMS, health workers must change their antimicrobial prescribing behaviour to only prescribe these drugs for patients whose indications warrant antimicrobials and choose antimicrobials in a hierarchical (stepwise) manner, with preference to those with the least spectrum Prescribing behaviour is a manifestation of a abilities of a person that integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes towards performance of a given Competencies are transferrable through training, coaching, and mentoring, and can be measured (as basic, intermediate and advanced)."
"Once acquired, competencies are durable (sustainable or long-lasting)."
"Achieving AMS in health facilities requires healthcare workers to have core competencies in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes for better use of antimicrobial drugs."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - AMS: Planning an AMS program; Performing AMS interventions; Assessing an AMS program As shown in Annex 3, each of these modules is associated with a set of competencies which healthcare workers in a health facility undertaking AMS Program need."
"These AMS competences should be graded into three incremental levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced."
"Basic competencies: The professional is aware of, has knowledge of, or understands the core Intermediate competencies: The professional is aware of the core principles of AMS, understands them, and knows how to apply them in his/her practice."
"Advanced (expert) competencies: The professional is aware of the core principles of AMS, understands them, knows how to apply them in his/her practice, can show others how to apply them, and provides leadership, expertise, or support to others in this area."
"After some time into the implementation of the AMS, particularly after monitoring and evaluation of the AMS program through periodic antibiotic use surveys, further competency assessments and refresher training responsive to the emerging needs may be triggered."
"However, AMS champions should be aware that simply providing knowledge passively by sharing facts rarely changes behavior."
This is because the knowledge gap alone is rarely the most important barrier to appropriate use.
"Therefore, AMS champions should employ persuasive messaging as a fundamental component of educational strategies."
The success of these strategies relies on the availability of standard treatment guidelines or protocols to set the standard of care health workers should adhere to.
"In all educational interventions, the following principles should apply: Focusing on context-specific problems for the target group 2."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Allows pre and postassessment of the Costly in terms of resources Poor concentration of the participants (requires very understanding/ (information Not very effective and timeconsuming Sometimes it is difficult to information  difficult to reach Time consuming, tedious and Overall impact may be small May create fear or discomfort Very dependent on emotions experience and skills to deliver Needs someone with skills and"

"Stake Holder Engagement: Include all stake holders such as; the unaware, the resistant, the neutral, the supportive and those ones leading AMS activities in the facilities and communities 7.6 Responsible entities for AMS awareness, education, and training The AMS teams and subcommittees at a health facility level are mandated to conduct AMS trainings to the health care workers, VHTs, and health facility support staff."
Health facilities are encouraged to conduct the trainings at least on a quarterly basis.
"For patients and caretakers, the healthcare workers are mandated to educate them on adherence and appropriate use of antimicrobials."
Healthcare workers are encouraged to prioritize health education on AMS as per the Mo.
"At the point of dispensing antimicrobials to the patients and or caretakers, healthcare workers are reminded to emphasize adherence and consequences of their irrational use."
"H should train private health At district level, community AMS education, training and advocacy should be overseen by the District Health Office."
"For VHTs and community members, health promotion and awareness activities should be led by the District Health Educators (DHE)."
The VHTs should oversee the training in the community / public on AMS under the supervision of the DHEs.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Implementing health facility antimicrobial stewardship interventions involves a systematic approach to promoting appropriate use of antimicrobial medications to combat antimicrobial resistance and improve patient outcomes.
Healthcare facility AMS action plan endorsed that prioritizes activities and measures progress and accountability Budget and allocate resources for the healthcare facility AMS action A multidisciplinary AMS leadership committee is in place with clear The AMS subcommittee should identify a dedicated AMS leader/ champion to lead the AMS team.
To develop/mobilize and disseminate AMS IEC materials for health To engage the community and public on antimicrobial stewardship through health education and outreach programs.
One of the goals of antimicrobial stewardship programs at facility level is quality improvement.
Implementation should take on a systematic approach as described in the Quality improvement Establishing a healthcare facility AMS program requires a systematic and step wise approach.
A situational/SWOT analysis should be conducted before an AMS program is established to determine what needs to be done and what can be done.
The analysis should include: Mapping which core elements are in place in the facility.
"In addition, the analysis should include identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) at different levels in the facility; and possible barriers and enablers for the full participation of the different healthcare professionals and Health Facility Top Management Medicines & Therapeutic Committee Overall supervisory group for antimicrobial stewardship Hold MTC committee meetings at least once every two months Report to the Health facility management Antimicrobial Stewardship Subcommittee Multidisciplinary group appointed by the to oversee the whole AMS program Hold AMS committee meetings at least once every two months Report to the MTC committee Member of the AMS subcommittee Reports on progress of AMS activities to the AMS subcommittee Comprise healthcare workers from different health facility Serve as AMS focal persons Implement AMS activities at dept level Hold monthly AMS team meetings"
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - The situational and/or SWOT analysis will help the healthcare facility in developing a stepwise AMS action plan that identifies what is already in place (healthcare facility core elements), what needs to be put in place over time (short and medium/long-term priorities), the human resources needed (including champions), the composition of an AMS team and other core elements (including guidelines) based on the facility core elements checklist and priorities."
"An example of a SWOT analysis can be found in Annex 58.2.2 Developing an AMS action plan The health care facility AMS action plan should be developed based on situational analysis to ensure accountability, prioritize activities, and measure progress."
"The AMS action plan should provide an overview of the facility AMS program with overall goals, how they will be reached by whom, and how progress will be measured over a specific period."
"AMS activities or interventions should be applied in a phased manner, starting with the simplest and eventually advancing to more complex activities."
"The action plan should include time-bound Determine priority core elements to be implemented in the short and medium term, including accountability, timeline, and indicators (Refer to Section 8.1)."
"An example of an AMS action plan can be found in Annex 68.2.3 Implement health facility AMS interventions After developing the AMS action plan, the plan should be implemented to realize behavior change in antibiotic prescribing practices and responsible use of antibiotics."
The interventions are primarily informed by the findings of the situational and SWOT analysis.
Intrinsic factors that may influence prescribing behavior should also be addressed.
"Therefore, performing AMS interventions requires that they be tailored to address the facility-specific factors that may influence antibiotic prescribing and use."
"Two ways of tailoring AMS interventions are: Apply a systematic and stepwise approach to implementing AMS interventions, review progress over time, and make changes when appropriate."
"The interventions can generally be classified into; Educational, managerial, regulatory, and economic/financial."
"However, studies have shown that combining multiple strategies, are significantly more effective than single strategy initiatives."
"A detailed list of interventions is included in Annex 78.3 Behaviour change One main outcome of performing AMS interventions in a healthcare facility is behaviour change in antibiotic prescribing practices, leading to more responsible use of antibiotics."
"In the implementation of AMS activities, it is important to recognize that the behavior of the healthcare professionals is a key source of variance that must be understood before effective uptake can be reliably achieved."
Physician autonomy in prescribing what he or she thinks is best.
"Consequently, when performing AMS interventions, implementation requires that they be tailored to address the different factors that may influence antibiotic prescribing and use in a specific"

"Introduction to AMR Understand the morbidity, mortality and economic threat Use of antibiotics in humans, animals, plants and Understand the development and main drivers of antimicrobials in the human and animal sectors to Understand that travel, recent previous microbiology findings of resistant bacteria are factors that predispose to colonization/infection with a resistant pathogen."
"Understand single prophylactic antibiotic dosing for surgical and other procedures for which prophylaxis has been shown to be effective, and use this knowledge when prescribing."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Understand that an inflammatory response can be due to both infectious and non-infectious causes (e.g., acute pancreatitis)."
"Understand when not to prescribe antibiotics (e.g., for viral infections, or when there is bacterial colonization)."
Understand best practices for some infections may not include antibiotic treatment (e.g.
"Be able to communicate with patients on the appropriate use of antibiotics, including patient counseling etiquette, discussion techniques and Promote better patient understanding of all treatment issues, such as safety concerns (including alerts) and Promote a standard for the appropriate use of antibiotics and manage patient expectations and demands especially when the use of antibiotics is not"
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Understand the significance of common antimicrobial and drug/food interactions and utilize strategies to Understand that optimizing antimicrobial use can limit common side effects and collateral damage related to treatment (e.g., disruptive effects on host normal flora, which may lead to C. difficile infection, super infection with Candida spp.)."
"Understand what to do when common side effects documenting allergic reactions in patient records, Encourage adherence to antimicrobial formulary / Discourage use of fixed-dose combinations of different antibiotics that have not been shown to Ensure regular and timely supply of appropriate appropriate use of antimicrobials according to their AWa."
"Be able to interpret and use basic antimicrobial susceptibility testing results (in settings where they are commonly used) and other microbiology testing tools: blood cultures, urine samples, wound samples Be able to interpret and use new, more advanced microbiology samples, biomarkers, point-of-care Understand how to use and interpret investigations that can help inform diagnosis of an infection (e.g."
Understand how to use and interpret investigations point-of-care tests) that can help in monitoring the response to treatment of infections.
Understand that empirical treatment should be guided by local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.
Ensure that health workers have the knowledge and awareness of effective approaches/interventions to control AMR and have the skills to implement change Understand basic principles of behavior change in the context of prescribing antimicrobials and model good prescribing behavior to colleagues.
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - frameworks to address gaps and to improve Understand the key elements of a logical approach to continuation and appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy and be able to implement AMS interventions: impairment), and where to seek advice about this."
Success of educational interventions depends on how the information is presented.
Visual and audio aids (posters/power point presentations) can be useful.
"A problem-based approach (e.g., through actual case studies on real patients) is more likely to be effective than textbook lectures."
"Small group meetings are also more effective than large group Educational programmes should be provided along with guidance and policies and the tools and structures needed to follow them (e.g., if the message is to prescribe antimicrobial A instead of antimicrobial B, antimicrobial A has to be made available!)."
"All health workers should regularly/routinely provide patient education about appropriate therapy and adherence to drug regimens, so leading to improved health outcomes."
"Face-to-face individual teaching is the most effective (e.g., as done by drug sales representatives), though time-consuming."
"It usually targets prescribers, has few key messages to convey and is usually followed up with a reinforcement visit two or three times to strengthen the likelihood of behavior change."
Influencing opinion leaders has been shown to influence prescribing habits significantly.
"Junior officers tend to copy the habits of their senior, so a face-to-face with an opinion leader may have a cascade For example, treatment guidelines, newsletters, bulletins, literature, illustrated persuasive material (flyers, poster)."
Having a reliable source of unbiased and updated information augments other educational There should be a small drug resource center/library with at least 2-3 current authoritative books.
"Local bulletins can be periodically produced by the MTC or provided by an external source (e.g., MOH, WHO)."
"Good printed materials: Information should be concise, simple and brief; key points should be repeated, not lengthy; they should have short but catchy headings, visually appealing illustrations; the information should be oriented towards actions and decisions."
"They should have respected sponsors e.g., MOH, WHO."
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Posters, audio tapes, plays, radio, TV, social networks Used especially for patient education Can reach many people but not very effective in changing behavior Functional MTC with clear TORs and an Personnel on the AMS sub-committee are trained in AMR surveillance as well as antimicrobial use surveys Antimicrobial use and resistance data: Presence of a functional Microbiology Routine Point Prevalence surveys are Regular activity reports on surveillance and health facility staff."

Revising and updating the National Certification Framework for HIV Rapid Testing is integral to our commitment to ensuring the reliability and accuracy of HIV testing services nationwide.
"Despite these advancements, challenges in maintaining quality and consistency in HIV testing have persisted, particularly with the decentralization of testing services and the involvement of lay testers."
"This framework is designed to ensure that all testing sites and personnel meet stringent quality requirements, thereby minimizing the risk of misdiagnosis and improving the overall reliability of HIV test results."
"Key to the success of this framework is the rigorous training and certification of HIV testers and sites following audits and evaluations, respectively, along with the implementation of robust quality assurance measures."
"By adhering to these standards, we aim to provide accurate HIV diagnoses, link individuals to appropriate care and treatment promptly, and ultimately reduce the transmission of HIV within our This document serves as a crucial resource for policymakers, programmers, healthcare providers, researchers, and all stakeholders involved in HIV testing and prevention."
"Together, we can enhance the quality of HIV testing services, ensure accurate and reliable test results, and make significant strides toward achieving the UNAIDS targets by 2030."
Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the development of this important document and for your continued dedication to improving the health and well-being of all Acting Director General of Health Services
This document was developed through the contributions and expertise of several Individuals and Institutions.
"The core technical working group was constituted of Pontiano Kaleebu, Edward Katongole Mbidde, Robert Mutumba, Peter Mudiope, Christine Katusiime, Geoffrey Taasi, Christine Watera, Rose Akide, Mary Naluguza, Joel Opio, Malinga Florence Namimbi, Madina Apolot, Winnie Agwang, Patrick Ogwok, Pidson Tumushabe, Charles Nahabwe Kaahwa, Macreen Mudoola, and Anna Akello."
Heterosexual intercourse and mother-to-child are the main modes of transmission.
"Of these, 96.1% were receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) while 92.2% of those on ART were virally suppressed."
"During this time, emphasis was placed on expanding entry points, scaling up HCT for children, utilizing Lay Providers, and community testing."
"As a result, by the end of 2014, approximately  HTS sites were established nationwide."
"In 2016, the key focus was to align existing policy guidelines with the WHO HTS guidelines and the national HIV/AIDS strategic plan, as well as to address HTSrelated legal issues arising from the HIV Prevention and Control Act 2014."
"By the end of 2017, there were over  testing sites in the country."
"In 2015, WHO recommended that individual countries develop mechanisms for assessing HIV testers and testing sites to enhance the quality of HIV rapid testing and ensure zero HIV misdiagnosis2."
"Certification gives formal recognition that a facility/site or tester is authorized to carry out a specific task, such as HIV rapid testing for diagnosing HIV"
National certification programs are an effective way to ensure the reliability and accuracy of test results and encourage continuous quality improvement for HIV rapid testing.
A successful certification program requires the involvement of stakeholders with specific The benefits of a National HTS Certification Program are listed below: Facilitates the implementation and maintenance of an effective quality Gives confidence to users in the services provided Gives confidence to the site and user for the results generated Provides recognition of technical competence Provides legal cover to the tester/testing site Reduces the operating costs of HIV testing by getting results right the first time Certification is done at regular intervals to ensure the maintenance of standards.
"Provider certification verifies that the provider performing HIV rapid testing is adequately trained, is authorized to do so, has evidence of demonstrated competency, and that the testing sites adhere to minimum HIV rapid testing requirements."
Point-of-care testing (POCT) technologies have become widely available in the last few years and play a major role in achieving increased access to diagnostics.
"As access to POCT expands in low- and middle-income countries, there is a need for simple, practical, and low-cost innovative approaches to ensure sustainable quality assurance practices that lead to accurate and reliable HIV rapid test results and improved public health outcomes."
Addressing the common quality-related causes of incorrect results and errors requires making concerted efforts at all levels to systematically improve and assure the quality of testing.

"Standards for certifying HIV Rapid testing sites and testers The result of a laboratory test, performed within or outside the laboratory, is an essential and life-saving support within the health care system."
"Therefore, quality-assured testing of all samples is critical for decision-making in patient care management."
International standards are now widely used in implementing quality in developed countries as well as developing countries.
"A question bank has been developed with an HTS-related context from which theoretical examinations will be set, coupled with practical examinations to assess personnel competency."
"Each site should have minimum quality standards to provide safe and effective HTS, which include: The physical facility/site should have: Adequate space, lighting, and environmental control (temperature and Organized and clean workspace Secure storage facilities for reagents, supplies, and equipment The site should have organized systems and processes in place, providing for the safety of staff, clients, and the community."
"PPE should be available, properly and consistently used Have and maintain appropriate first aid material All testing personnel trained on handling bio-hazardous material, workplace safety, and spill management, evidenced by documentation of these trainings The testing site should have a standardized system for client handling and identification, specimen collection and processing, and records of patient/specimen information."

To provide a clear communication channel for the effective flow of information 7.3 Communication approaches Different approaches shall be employed for effective communication with all stakeholders about the HIV rapid testing certification program.
Mobilization approaches should be tailored to the needs and contexts of different target audiences.
All HIV rapid testing certification messages should be designed to address the unique needs of the targeted audiences.
A detailed communication plan is shown in

Strong community health systems are vital for delivering essential services to the hard-to-reach underserved populations.
"Therefore, investing in community health is one cost-effective approach to healthcare and the foundation of enhancing integrated community health service delivery with a life-course approach from grassroots."
"It is my conviction that if National Community Health Strategy is implemented properly, the performance of the health sector will greatly improve they are implemented fully, the performance of the health sector will be transformed."
The NCHS implementation guidelines is an initiative of guideline has been developed in line with existing national legal and policy framework for community health.
"The guidelines provide a framework for the community health service implementation, detailing its structure and service delivery channels."
"Additionally, it is introducing and defining an integrated essential community services package which is based on a life Given the diverse implementation arrangement and various cadres involved in community health, consolidating all critical community health programs into one single guideline document allows all stakeholders to clearly grasp their respective roles and responsibilities."
The effective operationalization of the NCHS using the guideline is essential for ensuring alignment with Local Governments (LGs) priorities and
"Community health  Community health refers to non-treatment based health services that health workers work with primary care providers to facilitate entry into, exit from and utilization of the formal health system by community members as well as providing supplementary services such as support groups or wellness events that are not offered by medical institutions  Community health focuses on interrelated conditions and factors influencing the health of populations throughout their lives."
"It identifies systematic variations in health patterns and applies this knowledge to develop and implement actions aimed at improving the health and well-being of all community members, particularly the vulnerable and marginalized populations."
"Staying healthy is mostly The community we live, learn, play or work (e.g., norms, stigma, parenting care, housing, Individual choices we make (e.g., exercise, alcohol and drugs, smoking, diet, safety, early care seeking practices, use of bed nets,"

"While vital, its effect are often confined to individual cases."
"Increasing opportunities to enhance awareness about healthy lifestyles, preventive measures, and the importance of early disease detection is crucial."
"Investing in community health should empower communities to better identify and address their health challenges on an ongoing basis, thereby contributing to sustained improvements in health outcomes."
"Community health interventions are particularly well-suited to address health needs associated with lifestyle-related diseases, home care, aging populations, and the growing segment of young people."

To Provide guidance on monitoring the implementation of Community Health programs within the district and city health systems The guidelines is structured based on the 4 main objectives mentioned above This guideline provides an opportunity to implement an integrated community health service package.
It is organized around four key sections (objectives).
"Currently, community health approaches are siloed in disease based programs with many overlapping and inter-related sub-systems."
"Therefore, the guideline begins with building district level readiness for the implementation by enhancing their capacity to deliver the integrated community health Section 1: Focuses on implementation process within health facility catchment area and also provides the integrated essential community health service package and the community platforms through which the package should be delivered to reach different populations and Section 2: Explains the governance, management and community health workforce structures and their responsibilities in the implementation process Section 3: Presents how districts/city health health planning and management process within the D/CHMT, and how they strengthen"
The concept of facility catchment area (F-CAPA) is derived from the hub and spoke model where the facility in question is the primary health care facility.
The facility has all technical human resources trained to manage PHC interventions.
The CHEWS who are based at the parishes served by this facility are all attached to the facility and so are the VHTS.
"A catchment area: means the population, for which a health facility has responsibility."
"The sequencing of the facility catchment area planning process in this guide is designed to fit within this period, operating in annual and three-month cycles."
The community health plan is a component of the health facility plan guided by the Mo.
"H planning guidelines, which is subsequently incorporated within the sub-county local government development plan."
The facility should also map all Community Health assets (including the Community Health Workers using the Community Health workers Registry) and stakeholders.
Prioritization should include: Aggregation of village and parish action plans Consideration of community barriers or challenges Identify and rank the problems according to their scores from the facility catchment area health assessment.
"Step 3: Development of Annual Community Health components of Facility Plan Based on the priorities, facilities will develop an annual work plan detailing activities, intervention areas, affected locales, responsible persons and timelines for execution."
"Step 5:  Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation Roll out the area-wide plan, ensuring that activities and interventions are aligned with defined objectives."
"These Facility/ sub-county reviews are informed by HMIS, client feedback and Community Led monitoring (CLM) to assess and track progress and inform changes to improve Encourage and create space for community stakeholders, partners including CBOs, CSOs and the private sector, to participate actively and meaningfully in these reviews."
Implementation of this package is expected to yield several benefits.
The intervention package to be implemented within the National Community Health Strategy (NCHS) is prioritized for the 1.
Large Impact on Population Health: the selected interventions have been demonstrated to significantly improve health outcomes at the population level.
"Improvement of the Quality and health Outcomes of Personal-level Care Services: the package   is   designed to enhance the delivery, quality and effectiveness of personal 3."
Integration of Existing Community Health Interventions: the package consolidates and integrates various existing community health interventions to create a more efficient The objectives for selecting the interventions are outlined 1.
"To ensure effectiveness of this integrated essential community health service package, a comprehensive suite of services has been delineated for each age group."
Efforts should be made to ensure that these services can be received through one or multiple contacts or providers.
"The community platforms are settings where individuals live, study, work, and engage in recreational activities, and these are where Community Health interventions are specifically tailored."
"While packages are delivered at these platforms, the primary goal is to establish health promoting, protective and disease-prevention environments (Healthy settings) rather than merely implementing community health interventions."
"The role of the CHW is to facilitate the platforms, enabling them to utilize their resources and strengthen collective problem identification and action, including improving conditions for community health providers to engage with the community."
"Urban areas also have critical settings such as markets, neighborhood groups, and clubs, which play important roles in advancing health."
"For community health interventions to be effective, they should encompass activities across multiple settings."
Coordinate with national programs on the essential Community Health service package and develop a unified master training curriculum guide for CHWs to be utilized Train a pool of master trainers.
"Utilize data to conduct targeted community disease prevention and health promotion priorities, which are communicated and implemented through the regionalized hub-and-spoke model within their geographical health regions."
"Local governments should ensure that these structures are established at the outset to guarantee a clear understanding of their roles and the capacity to participate effectively in Health offices, supported by the principal Health Education Officer shall be responsible for the overall performance and coordination of integrated community health services."
"Support supervision of health facilities to establish sub-counties and develop local government coverage plans for delivering community health services, including Map social service providers and develop a community referral and follow up protocol to strengthen and streamline linkages between the community and health facilities."
"The community health workforce at the facility is comprised of various cadres, each with specific responsibilities."
Coordinate all Community Health stakeholders and ensure that the activities of partners working at the sub-county level are included in the sub-county and health
"Depending on the existing organization of the community, this team may establish a Catchment Stakeholder Forum that brings together all community health actors in the sub-county."
Such a forum should define key community resources for mobilization.
"Community health activities will be derived for each parish through Parish Action Plans, which are informed by various village community action plans by identifying crosscutting issues to be addressed at the parish level."
"The designated Parish CHW Coordinator will work to link the facility with the Parish Chief to provide support supervision, mentorship, and troubleshooting to CHWs, as well as coordinate with the PSSC on community health agendas."
"Their key roles will be: Coordinate, oversee, and provide administrative supervision (non-technical) of community health activities in their areas, covering all elements within the essential community health service package."
"The CHEW is required to spend 60% of her/ his working time outside the HCII, dealing with model families, community groups or households."
Be available to the community to respond to questions and provide advice.
Report to the CHWs on the activities they have been involved in and any specific health problems encountered that need to be escalated to higher levels.
Household members and caretakers are expected to maintain a healthy and safe Household members should support care and offer psychological first aid to patients at Household members should support surveillance and neighborhood health monitoring.
Households should engage in the cascade of the model household approach.
Household members should initiate the referral of patients from the household to Adhere to health worker guidance.
These steps may not be linear and might require repetition.
"Step 1: Pre-visit and Briefing the DHMT The entire D/CHMT should be briefed on the aims and objectives of community health, including the bene- fits, roles, and model to be applied."
"Additionally, the districts role in assisting facilities to provide integrated community health services must be clearly defined."
"Integration is a comprehensive process that involves various members of the D/CHMT and During this step, the assessment will encompass several aspects: Community Health interventions, adherence to relevant Mo."
"Additionally, assess the capacities of health facilities to implement catchment area planning and actions to determine the number of facilities that can be transitioned in a particular year."
"This mapping should identify the highest-level health facility in the sub-county, which will serve as the anchor facility for that sub-countys Furthermore, map the health management processes based on the NCHS pillars, with the aim of establishing how integrated Community Health planning, procurement and supply chain management (PSM), financing, reporting and service delivery can be optimized within Step 4: Selecting and Training District Community Health Trainers/supervisors The Training of district trainers aims to engage national master trainers in coaching a pool of district Community Health trainers."
This initiative should develop a cadre of competent supervisors capable of supporting lower and community-level activities over the long term.
"The trained team will develop a Community Health implementation plan, which is essential for guiding the transformation process."
"The shift towards a community health focus is gradual, with varying paces across different facilities based on their catchment population context and the availability of active CHWs."
"The plan should outline the activities to be undertaken, the timeframe, responsible individuals, and budget."
"The core activities include, but are not limited to: Selection and training of a pool of trainers from the Community Health workforce, and implementation of F-CAPA."
"Managing Community Health commodities, supplies, tools, IEC materials and Integrated Community Health management, community engagement and monitoring Efforts to scale up the delivery of integrated and effective Community Health interventions have been hindered by weak LG health systems.Three key management levers for improving Community Health management have been synthesized, addressing the identified health system bottlenecks."
Strengthening management support in these areas will ultimately improve the delivery and coverage of priority high-impact Community Health interventions.
"Strengthening integrated Community Sub-section 3.CBuilding facility readiness to Sub-section 3.BBuilding linkages for action on social determinants of health Harmonizing planning, budgeting, Training, support supervision, Assessing and preparing health facilities to implement quality Community Health services and Health program Management There are diverse programs addressing multiple diseases within their packages, notably Integrated Community Case Management (ICCM+), CAST+, HIV, Key Family Practices, and others, all these are delivered by different CHWs."
The aim of integration in this guideline is to:
Integrate services that are similar or connected.
Optimize resource allocation and improve funding for health priorities that are overlooked by existing funding mechanisms and funders.
"Districts progress along these lines as illustrated in Burden of disease by age, condition, population group, Improved holistic wellbeing community level drivers of poor platforms on health determinants Integrated and life course promotion, prevention protection, responsive to holistic need Predominantly disease episode delivering community-based Fragmented short-term, partner driven community interventions To achieve integrated Community Health service delivery and improved health outcomes in the community, it is essential to strengthen the district/City health system across all levels."
Leadership for Integrated Community Health Service Management Technical managers are largely focused on ensuring the success of their own programs and professional interests.
This has resulted in significant overlaps in roles and fragmented implementation of Community Health components based on disease programs.
Community Health technical officers have a voice in influencing the content and direction of Community Health initiatives.
"Implementing Partners (IPs), Community Health technical officer has a specific area of expertise, and together they form a team with diverse skills working towards a common Community Health goal."
"Set clear resolution for overlapping scopes through the functional organizational structure Biostatistician, epidemiologist, Community Health leadership is required not only from those who are most senior but also Community Health leadership is required not only from those who are most senior but also from those who are responsible for leading services, teams, and the professional practice of others."
"It is essential to provide opportunities for individuals with lived experience of health care, as well as local communities, to influence and lead integrated services."
Integrating CHW Training and Supportive Supervision Systems integration efforts should be made to improve the low number of trained Community Health Workers (CHWs).
The supportive supervision and training for CHWs and their supervisors are
"Furthermore, the fragmented service delivery and weak connection between community health and healthcare facilities can result in referral difficulties that Efforts should be made to provide appropriate training, support and workload management, so that every single, repeated interface with any CHW fosters delivery of the full suite of services."
"To achieve this, the team should: Establish shared technical program trainings, supportive supervision and site visits for CHWs and their facility supervisors."
"Integrated Community Health Commodity and Supply Chain Management Efforts are needed to ensure supplies, tools, and equipment are adequate as the current insufficiency challenges capacity to deliver the core Community Health service package."
"There is need to address gaps in tracking the availability of commodities at the community level, based on community health need and consumption data."
"Electronic Community Health Information System (Functional integration) Efforts are needed to ensure Village Health Team (VHT) supplies, tools, and equipment are adequate, as the current insufficiency challenges their capacity to deliver the core"
"There is a need to address gaps in tracking the availability of commodities at the community level, based on community health needs and consumption data."
"To achieve this, the team should: Using a shared matrix of Community Health status indicators in planning and reporting on achievements of across all programs Rolling out of use of e. CHIS including real-time data visualization, feedback and data use for decision making and use Community Health dashboard to visualize individual VHT Support Quarterly Community Health data quality and Performance Reviews Peoples health is primarily shaped by factors beyond the health sector, yet the burden of treating diseases falls on the health sector with limited resources."
"Health is a complex outcome influenced by various factors, requiring a holistic approach beyond siloed necessitating collaboration and partnerships with other Ministries, and commitment from various local leadership at community."
"This guideline aims to enhance multi-sectoral efforts for health promotion, emphasizing an integrated approach at the sub county level, which prioritizes actions on social determinants (where people are born, grow, live, study, work, and age) and community systems aligned 1."
Coordinate efforts across district and lower levels to improve health outcomes.
Intersectoral collaboration is less effective or sustainable if it relies on only one structure or mechanism.
LG Executive Councils should establish top political leadership as champions for
LG Social Services or General-Purpose committees should provide objective oversight and receive reports on the impact of other and equity outcomes.
They should be involved in advocating for the active participation 3.
Various partnership platforms and mechanisms are being utilized in intersectoral actions to tackle social determinants of health at local levels.
"This working group should work towards increasing adaptation, use, and complementarities of materials and messages from the different sectors, as well as joint field activities including supervision and training."
"Districts/cities should reorient facility staff and management to make them ready to deliver the integrated essential community health service package, lead in inter sectoral action on social determinants, and meaningly engage the community in health through Facility Catchment Area Planning and Action (F-CAPA)."
"To enable this, management support functions, trainings and supportive supervision for this process should be undertaken by the DHMT guided by the National Master trainers."
This orientation may also involve other technical partners.
"The team should map existing community systems, assets, gatekeepers, and platforms for engagement."
A community consultation should be convened to explain the concept and the plan for transitioning to integrated services.
The views of stakeholders and communities (both positive and negative) should be documented.
"Regular consultations should be organized throughout the process to provide and receive ongoing feedback, helping to improve the Step 3: Prepare to deliver F-CAPA The delivery of F-CAPA relies on health care workers and extension workers who are skilled and operate in a supportive environment."
"All health workers should be trained on the application of national guidelines, and refresher trainings should be organized to address capacity gaps."
"This includes: Ordering commodities, supplies, furniture and equipment: All Community Health commodities and supplies should be ordered through the health facility supply chain Reporting and accountability: All commodities dispensed/utilized and services provided in the community by CHWs should be reported timely through the existing Strengthening coordination:  Clear and accessible referral pathways are vital for an integrated essential community health service package."
"Stakeholders could include (but are not limited to): Partners, CSOs, CBOs, self-help groups, advocacy groups, and groups of underserved or Engaging and empowering people and communities: Community engagement efforts will have integrated approach and leverage on the PDM social services pillar, the PHCCE implementation framework."
"Depending on the readiness, resources available, capacity, and size, districts may decide to introduce some of the Community Health interventions and packages at scale from the start."
"Quality and consistent supervision of CHWs, an enabling policy environment, a comprehensive community mobilization campaign, continuously available commodities, and other conditions are necessary to position the integrated package as an effective strategy."
Efforts to categorize these dimensions have led to the creation of indices and benchmarks that assist program planners and managers in measuring success at different phases of implementation.
"Data collected in the community and at health facilities is of an operational nature and is most needed at the facility, parish and village levels  the levels closest to the people served."
"For community health, the community is where the most information should originate and where most community health service action takes place."
Both paper-based and electronic CHIS tools should assist those responsible for managing community health at each level of the health system and strengthen their accountability.
All community-level activities in the catchment area should be monitored on the CHIS platform and reported to the catchment facility.
"The CHIS within the DHIS2 should provide a common platform for partners, implementers, CSOs and the private sector to align and harmonize their M&Esystems."
"Partners and operational services will identify key core outcome indicators that they contribute to and help develop systems such as the quarterly update of VHT household registers to routinely capture and track population health indicators, understanding that other data will be collected through surveys."
"At the district level, CHIS data should be collected and presented to local governments"
Community-led monitoring efforts should be promoted and supported to improve the responsiveness and quality of both facility and Community Health services.
This should build on existing programs like HIV/AIDS and be led by the district biostatistician.
"The community scorecard is a powerful tool to monitor services, empower community members, and improve the accountability of service providers."
The scoring exercises provide community members with the opportunity to analyze health services based on their personal perceptions.
"Community Health: The health status and well-being of a group of individuals living in a specific locality or sharing common Population Health: The holistic approach of assessing and addressing the health outcomes of entire group or population, considering factors such as health disparities, social determinants of health, and the distribution of health risks within Community Engagement: Involving and empowering community members in decision-making, planning, and implementation of health initiatives, ensuring their voices and perspectives are Sub-county Wide Planning and Action for Health: A coordinated and integrated approach to planning and implementing health initiatives across a specific geographical area, typically encompassing various communities or villages."
Community Health Worker: A frontline cadre who serves as a liaison and intermediary between health and social services and the community to facilitate access to services and improve the qualityof-service delivery.
"Intersectoral Collaboration: Collaboration between different sectors, such as health, education, social development, and local government, to address the complex and interconnected factors that affect Data-Driven Decision Making: The use of data and evidence to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of community health strategies, ensuring that actions are targeted and Advocacy: Actions taken to promote policies, practices, and resources that improve community health, often involving raising awareness, influencing public opinion, and mobilizing support for healthrelated issues."
"Evidence-Based Interventions: Strategies and actions that have been proven effective through reliable research and evidence in addressing specific health issues within a Capacity Building: The process of strengthening the communitys ability to identify, plan, and implement solutions to health challenges, often through training, resource allocation, and skill development."
"Health Promotion The process of enabling people to increase control over, and to Disease prevention is aimed at preventing the occurrence of disease by reducing risk factors, stopping disease progression and mitigating its consequences if established."
"The mother should get support from her family and community in seeking care during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, after delivery and during the lactation period."
"Ensure that pregnant women and children sleep under insecticide treated nets (ITNs) every night and accept to have their houses sprayed by authorities Male involvement in pregnancy and child care Ensure that men are involved in the process of offering care to women during pregnancy, childbirth, and after birth, when accessing family planning"

"Household and family:  Health outcomes of newborns be it positive or negative, are largely determined by decisions made by the mothers, fathers, and other significant caregivers within the household."
"The model household approach is a means of empowering selected households with information on personal and household hygiene and environmental sanitation, family and reproductive health, communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCD) prevention and control practices so that the model households are able to influence other households in their communities to adopt the same practices."
Training of model households (illustration below) is one of the important CHEWs strategies and is adapted from the mass communication/ diffusion of innovations theory.
The basic philosophy of the CHEWs programme is to transfer ownership and responsibility for maintaining health to individual households through transfer of health knowledge and skills.
"To become model households, household members are trained on the model family package in their own community setting."
"When implementing the training, priority is given to activities that are easy and inexpensive to implement and are not contradictory to the Identify knowledge and skill gap for better family health Identify and screen change agents Select the households with the change agents for training Give theoretical as well as practical trainings for the selected households Monitor and evaluate health activities of the households afer training Better health at household level Expansion of the trainings and graduation of model HH Identify and screen community health volunteers and supervise or follow up of"

"Availability of sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services is critical to improving quality of care resulting into prevention, reduction and control of infectious diseases and associated mortality, improved occupational health, staff morale and performance and increased trust in health care services."
"In recognition of the importance of water availability and good hygiene during childbirth in particular, WASH is considered both a precondition and an entry point for good quality of care."
"The development of the guidelines was done through a consultative process that brought various governmental and nongovernmental organisations from the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector."
"It is hoped that everything possible shall be done to promote WASH in health care facilities to enhance the minimum conditions required for providing healthcare services in a healthy environment for healthcare workers, patients and visitors to the healthcare premises."

HA quantitative measure of acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous or other liquid solution that is, a number on a scale on which a value of 7 represents neutrality and lower numbers indicate increasing acidity while higher numbers increasing alkalinity."
A state of being free from public attention: In regard to sanitation its the ability of a facility to provide protection from disturbance or being observed by other people; shelter offering security to the user.
Private toilets are dedicated to one person over a specified time periodenvironmental cleaning always takes place before their use by a different person.
Shared toilets are used by more than one person within a specified time period and might not be cleaned before use by a Radioactive Waste.
"Radioactive Waste includes liquids, gas and solids contaminated with radio nuclides whose ionizing radiations have genotoxic effects."
An important difference between these types of radiations is that X-ray emissions occur when the generating equipment is switched on unlike in radiotherapy where the emissions occur as long as the patient is on therapy.

"Are community volunteers who are selected by communities to provide correct health information, mobilize communities and provide linkage to Visibly Soiled Hands."
"These are hands showing visible dirt or visibly contaminated with proteinaceous material, blood, or other body fluids (e.g."
The result is the subsequent increase of health services uptake.
"There is also evidence that, infections related to poor hygiene in health facilities are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity of mothers and children."
"Additionally, lack of adequate WASH services may also discourage women from giving birth in health care facilities (HCFs) or cause delays in health care-seeking (Velleman et al, 2014)."
Local health facilities that have poor water and sanitation are likely to be a contributing reason that many women chose home deliveries over going to health facilities (where sanitary conditions may be similar or worse).
"Generally, it was observed that most of the facilities have limited WASH services with hand washing facilities being the worst service provided."
"In Karamoja, 70 percent of the health facilities had limited water supply, 92 percent had limited sanitation facilities for instance latrines were insufficient and un hygienic, 80 percent had limited"
"Access to a reliable and safe water supply was mainly affected by the level of health care facility, to health centre IIIs."
"WASH in health centers is one of the neglected issues, as indicated in the assessment conducted by UNICEF with partners in 2018 and the Water."
It was noted that majority of the health centers had limited WASH services with hand washing facilities being the worst service provided.
"Therefore, WASH interventions are required to address gaps identified in health care facilities."
"Thirty-seven (60%) HCFs held trainings for new staff members in IPC and 34 (55%) assigned IPC responsibility to an individual, including a nurse in 40% of HCFs were improved, including boreholes in 14 (23%), rainwater collection in 13 (21%), a piped water connection in 12 (19%), and a public standpipe in 6 (10%)."
"At least one handwashing station was reported in 55 (92%) HCFs, 47 (78%) had 1-4, and 8 (13%) HCFs had 5."
The most common type of handwashing station observed was a covered container with a tap (54%).
Sinks were noted at 22% of observed handwashing stations.
"Drinking water was reported to be available to staff/patients at 32 (51%) HCFs; 33 (53%) of 62 HCFs reported separating sharps, infectious waste, and non-infectious waste; Eight (15%) of 62 HCFs used an improved site for sharps disposal (either an incinerator or lined pit for burning)."
Noninfectious waste was disposed of and burned onsite in all HCFs but only 6 (10%) HCFs used an improved disposal system.
Handwashing stations were available within meters of 66 (30%) out of 197 patient latrines.
"Latrines were separated by gender in 18 (30%) The provision of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in health care facilities serves to prevent infections and spread of disease, protect staff and patients, as well as uphold the dignity of vulnerable groups of people such as pregnant women and the disabled (WHO: 2015) and also Absence of guidelines in the provision of WASH services in health care facilities leads to inconsistencies especially in regard to planning, budgeting, designing, construction, operation, maintenance, monitoring, and evaluation for continuous quality control and sustenance."
"The aim of developing these guidelines is to offer epigrammatic instructions to the different stakeholders at all levels of service while addressing the various WASH related interventions in HCFs, so as to standardize all approaches within means (taking into consideration all the regional variations), during implementation and monitoring of activities for continuous improvement, and to enable efficient utilization of all the enormous resources."
Global Overview of WASH in HCFs Globally provision of WASH in HCFs is an obligation and no longer a luxury.
"Whereas it was found to be below expected coverage in a study conducted by WHO in 2015, not much has improved to date."
"Generally, in some circles its referred to as a forgotten cousin because it is not accorded the attention it deserves yet it plays a crucial role in health, socio-economic and developmental vitality."
"Most affected are the low- and mid-income countries where many factors contribute to the compromising positions, posing serious adverse effects to the health care workers, patients, caregivers and the environments served."
"Across the globe, there are many new and re-emerging pathogens spreading quickly around the globe to major cities in as little as 36 hours, resulting into epidemics and outbreaks that can potentially overwhelm health systems and devastate economies, if not cabbed with appropriate use of simple means as WASH."
"According to a survey conducted by Water Aid (in 2012), hand hygiene compliance among health care workers was approximately 40 percent in the developed world compared to 2.1 percent among the developing countries."
"As a measure to improve the status quo, several global health initiatives e.g."
"WHO and UNICEF in collaboration with several development partners worldwide have dedicated time and resources to implement a global action plan with five change objectives to address health and safety, disease prevention and treatment, staff morale and performance, people centered care, community WASH, health care costs, climate change and disaster resilience basing on a To ensure that by 2030 every healthcare facility in every setting has a safely managed reliable water, sanitation, hygiene facilities and practices to meet staff and patient needs in order to provide quality, safe people centered care with particular attention to the needs of women, girls and children."
"Furthermore, the WHO Director General declared that improving WASH in HCFs was an urgent priority."
"Infections related to poor hygiene in health facilities are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity of patients, healthcare workers and visitors to the healthcare facilities."
"These guidelines have been scoped from WHO standards, international and national guidelines on WASH /IPC, best practices and bench marking."
"Rationale for Developing the Guidelines The rationale for developing the guidelines is for documented procedures for provision of adequate water supply, sanitation, hygiene and waste management in HCFs for the achievement of positive effects, namely: Enhanced infection prevention control in HCFs among patients, healthcare workers, staff and visitors to the HCFs; Healthy environment offers psychological comfort for acceptability of healthcare"
"HCF users can learn and practice positive hygiene behaviors; Increased up-take of the healthcare services; The absence of guidelines in the provision of WASH services in HCFs leads to lack of uniformity especially with respect to planning and budgeting, technical designing and construction, O&M, quality control and monitoring of such interventions."
"These guidelines have been developed for use by the health managers and planners, health development partners, consultants, contractors, public and private health workers, health promoters and other health sector stakeholders."
Objectives of the guidelines The overall objective of these WASH guidelines is to put in place a uniform and harmonized approach in the provision of WASH services in public and private HCFs across the country.
"Guidelines provide a standard approach to guide stakeholders in addressing WASH challenges in health institutions in the country and to provide practical guidance for planning, budgeting, designs and specifications of recommended WASH facilities, operation and maintenance and monitoring of the performance of the services."

Health Unit Management Committees Health Unit Management Committees are key governance structures for HCIVs to HCII.
The purpose of the committees is to strengthen the management and governance of Health Centers for improved service delivery.
The availability of clean water in health facilities is critical to providing quality healthcare.
Workers in health care facilities need sufficient quantities of safe water to provide health care services.
"Water is also essential for cleaning rooms, beds, floors, toilets, sheets and laundry."
"It is central to patient experiences of health care, as it enables them to remain hydrated, to clean themselves, and to reduce the NDP III aims at improving population health, safety and management."
Among the interventions to be taken to achieve this is through increasing access to inclusive safe water and sanitation.
"Adequacy of water should be in terms of quantity, quality, reliability and accessibility."
The following are the recommended sources of water in HCFs singly or in combination depending on the assessment of the available water resources.
Protection: Can the water source be protected from present and future pollution and contamination and can the catchment area be protected effectively to ensure the sustainability of the quantity and quality of the raw water?
Connection to Existing Water Supply System It is recommended that healthcare facilities located close to piped water supply systems either operated by national water and sewerage corporation (NWSC) or umbrella organization (UO) should apply for a connection to ensure reliable water supply.
"Due to interruptions in the water supply due to breakdowns or maintenance works, healthcare facilities should have backup storage facilities with a two days water demand capacity."
While NWSC or UO will provide extension of
"Development of Self-supply Water Systems Healthcare facilities located in areas where there is no piped water supply systems operated by national water and sewerage corporation (NWSC) or umbrella organization, will have to develop their own water sources."
"A spring can be defined as a place where rock or clay layers block the flow of underground water, forcing it upwards where the outflow emerges in the open at the ground surface."
To locate good springs and to get information about their reliability especially during drought periods the designer should consult the local people resident in the area.
"To measure the yield of springs identified as potential sources for a water supply scheme, simple devices such as over-flow weirs and V-notches should be installed."
Spring yield is measured in Springs should be protected to prevent contamination by surface water.
"The following points should be considered when investigating a potential spring source: Ensure the spring is not really a stream which has gone underground and is reemerging; Ensure the source and the collection area are not likely to be polluted by surface runoff; Check that there are no latrines within 30 metres, particularly upstream of the spring; Fence the area around the spring tank to prevent pollution by children or livestock; Make sure that, if the spring is to be connected to a piped water system, it is on higher ground than the area to be supplied so the water will flow by gravity; and Take care that the spring tank is not built on swampy ground or on land which is subject to erosion or flooding and that the flow from the protected spring itself will not cause erosion or damage.5 To protect a spring the following steps are followed: Clean up the whole site by digging drainage trenches; Technical brief on Protection of spring sources by Water."
Place a layer of hardcore over which is an impervious clay layer; The spring water is collected and channelled to the discharge pipe in a concrete wall through a gravel layer; Spring water is collected and channelled through a gravel layer to the discharge pipe in the concrete wall.
The pipe is located at a convenient height to enable villagers to fill An impervious clay layer is used above and around the spring to restrict surface seepage.
"A drainage channel is dug to channel away storm water and a concrete paved access provided to enable users to easily fill containers; and A fence may be built to keep livestock out and the grass surrounding the spring kept Common materials are used in the construction of springs: Stones, aggregates and sand are obtained locally and cement used ordinary Portland cement."
The walls may also be built from local stone by skilled Fundis minimizing the use of cement hence lowering the cost.
Advantages of spring protection schemes: Water coming naturally to the surface limits need for pumping Low maintenance and running costs Can be high yielding source of good quality  no need for treatment Disadvantages of spring protection schemes Yield can diminish or dry up during extreme drought periods Regular maintenance needed around the spring head to prevent pollution Operation and Maintenance of springs Maintaining the integrity of the protective spring structure is important to ensure the risks from surface and subsurface contamination entering the spring are minimized.
"Where a spring box needs cleaning or maintenance work, standard operating procedures should be followed to ensure contaminants are not introduced into the spring during the work."
The following aspects have to be checked during regular visits to the catchment area (
Ensure the outlet is clean and functioning.
Check the fence or barrier is in good condition.
"Where present, ensure the spring box inspection port lid is in place, locked and in Where present, ensure the spring box air vent and overflow pipe is in place and in good condition."
Ensure protective vermin-proof screens are in good condition.
"Where a spring box is present, check the sediment levels."
The following steps are involved in the construction of boreholes: Before borehole drilling there is need to conduct a Hydro-geological Survey in the proposed site.
This ensures the best spot is selected according to the geological data.
"The hydro-geological data, maps, graphs and cross-section profiles obtained from the hydro-geological survey are used in determination of important information such as estimation of drilling depth and Identification of stress areas."
"Another aspect of borehole siting that demands careful consideration in populated areas is the potential for contamination by livestock and pit latrines or other waste disposal The choice of drilling method will depend on the location of the health facility and geological formations of the area such as the type of terrain, nature of aquifer and financial implications."
"Developing a well is the process of removing fine soil particles, drill cuttings, and residual drilling mud from the well screen and borehole annulus in order to establish a good hydraulic connection with the surrounding formation."
"Development also encourages a gravel filter pack to settle properly, eliminating voids, which may necessitate topping up the gravel pack a little."
"Sanitary seal - With borehole cleaning completed, the final job is the construction of a sanitary seal, which, as the name suggests, seals the borehole from surface contamination."
"This should also be the responsibility of the drilling contractor, and written into the work."
At least the uppermost two meters or so of annular space (probably that section formerly protected by the conductor pipe during drilling) should be cleaned out and dug into a fresh larger hole perhaps square in shape  surrounding the permanent casing.
"Then the top of the casing must be sealed with a locked cap or welded plate, on which the borehole identification number may Pumps and test pumping - After drilling has been completed and the sanitary seal put in place, borehole test pumping is carried out."
"It has the following objectives: To measure the performance of the borehole To determine the efficiency of the borehole, or variation of its performance under different rates of discharge To quantify aquifer characteristics, such as transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, and Checking verticality - After the testing equipment has been removed, a check of borehole verticality (plumbness) and alignment (straightness) should be conducted."
"This is usually done by inserting and lowering into the hole a perfectly straight, 12-metre-long steel rod or pipe, the external diameter of which should be a maximum of 13 mm (about 0.5 inch) less than the inner diameter of the main or longest section of casing."
"Disinfection - Finally, assuming that it has passed the tests above, the borehole should be thoroughly disinfected with a chlorine-rich solution, such as HTH (High-test Hypochlorite), leaving a concentration of residual chlorine of 50 milligrams/litre for at least four hours."
The borehole may then be re-sealed with the locked cap or welded plate.
"Continuous monitoring of borehole performance can be cost-effective, helping to detect any problems before they become serious."
"Maintenance programs should consist of regular field visits, water sampling (for chemical/microbial analyses), water level measurements, and routine monitoring by simple step-drawdown tests."
The data collected can be compared with those obtained when the well was new or last monitored.
"A regular testing schedule consisting of a basic step-drawdown test every year is sufficient, with maintenance carried out if there is any It is prudent to erect a lockable fence around the borehole to prevent tampering and accidental along with causes and suggested remedial actions."
"Lower pump inlet Deepen borehole Drill Check/compare earlier test pumping data Reduce pumping rate Rehabilitate: Inspect screens, surge-develop to clean screens Analyze water; if hazardous, shut down borehole production and reassess Analyze water."
The location should be carefully selected to ensure good potential for most of the year.
"The location selected should not be prone to flooding and pollution, especially by storm water from built up areas within the upper reaches of the micro-catchment."
Cut off drains should be constructed if this is feared.
No pit latrine or septic tank should be constructed upstream of the dug well.
"To ensure long term good water quality and quantity, it is essential to tackle the pollution problem through sensitization of the community."
"The diameter of a dug well should be at least 1.2m, to allow two people to work together during the digging exercise."
A slight smaller diameter may be used if the digging is to be done by one person only.
The well should be at least 3m below the expected lowest water level.
"Generally, the easiest and safest method of sinking a dug well is to excavate from inside of the precast concrete rings."
"In very loose soil, other methods such as hand drilling (augering) should be employed."
"In consolidated ground, including rock formations, the well may stand unlined but the upper section should always have a lining."
"However, in fine sand aquifers, the lining should not have openings or perforations, so that water only enters through the bottom of the well."
"The bottom of the well should be covered with graded gravel consisting of a 150mm thick layer of grain sizes 1-2mm overlain by a 150mm layer of grain sizes 4-8mm and this should be topped by a 150mm thick layer of grain sizes 20-30mm, to form a proper filter."
"The upper part of the lining should be water tight, to a depth of several meters below the lowest draw-down water level in the well."
"The annular space between the well walls and the lining should be sealed with puddle clay or cement grout, from the ground surface to the top of the aquifer or to at least 2m below the ground surface."
"The top of the lining should be extended to about 0.5m above the ground surface level, to form a wall around the well."
The well top should be sealed with a water-tight slab.
A manhole that can tightly and securely locked should be provided for the inspection and disinfection of the water in the well.
Source: Sustainable Sanitation and Water Management The term rainwater harvesting is usually taken to mean the immediate collection of rainwater running off surfaces upon which it has fallen directly.
"Where there is no surface water, or where groundwater is deep or inaccessible due to hard ground conditions, or where it is too salty, acidic or otherwise unpleasant or unfit to drink, another source must be sought."
"In areas which have regular rainfall the most appropriate alternative is the collection of rainwater, called rainwater Rainwater can be collected from most forms of roof."
"Tiled roofs, or roofs sheeted with corrugated mild steel are preferable, since they are the easiest to use and give the cleanest water."
Asbestos sheeting or lead-painted surfaces should be avoided due to their adverse health effects.
"The installation of gutters on roofs should take into consideration of the following: Gutters should be of either square or half circular section made from PVC or galvanized Gutters should be put in position using gutter brackets, made from PVC or metal stripes fixed to the fascia board of the building;"
"For very long gutters (>15m) fixed on fascia boards, the slope can be varied such that the first half of the gutters is laid at 0.5% slope and the rest at 1% slope to maintain reasonable gap between the gutter and the edge of the roof; (iv)	 Starting from the end nearest the tank, gutters should be laid into the brackets so that the next gutter sits inside a previous one with a 20cm overlap."
The brackets should be positioned such that it falls in the center of the overlap; and (v)	 The end of the gutters toward the tank should be provided with a down pipe and a purpose made first flush system; (vi)	 The ends of the gutter should be blocked with stoppers to reduce water loss.
"This introduces harmful bacteria in to storage water system, which can cause serious illness."
"In order to avoid this, routinely sweeping of the roof and removal of debris from gutters is reacquired."
"As a rough guide, the minimum storage capacity of a first flush device should be equivalent to 1mm of rainfall over the catchment area developed."
Type of soils bearing capacity The tank should be sited should be at least 1.5m from the existing building.
Tank sizing is important in determining the optimum capacity of a tank for a particular water demand catchment area and amount of rainfall available.
"When a tank is sized correctly, it avoids wastage of materials in building a tank that is too large and will never fill, or building a tank that is too small and always overflows."
"Cleaning the tank from inside at least twice a year or every start of the rainy season; Water disinfection with chlorine to make water safe for drinking Where first flush devices are not installed or operated properly, the storage tanks should be cleaned regularly e.g."
Gutters and covers should be cleaned periodically after leaf fall and soak pit dredged at least once a year.
"Minimum Water Requirements for HCFs Water demand in health institutions should be based on the situation prevailing at the time of scheme design, the development plans of the Governments, and the projected growth of the local population."
"Specific average water demand per facility will be determined based on average data available for OPD, IPD, staffing and various health services/procedures undertaken by the facility (See Water Supply for Minimum Per-capita Consumption in HCFs Minimum Water Quantity Requirement Operating Theatre /Maternity Unit Dry or supplementary Feeding Center 0.5-5 liters/consultation (Depending on waiting time) Wet or supplementary Feeding Center Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Center Acute Respiratory Diseases Isolation Ward Viral Haemorrhagic Fever Isolation Ward Source: WASH in Healthcare Facilities in Emergencies, The purpose of storing water in the HCFs is mainly to balance out the variations in water demand during the day and also to allow for emergency storage to ensure supply during break-downs."
The aggregate water volume required for both balancing and emergency purposes can be kept in one or more storage reservoirs.
The balancing storage is normally of the order of 30% of the maximum day demand for a 24hour constant supply rate.
Emergency storage is also considered in order to have water during daily peak demand even in case of a major break upstream of the reservoir.
It is usual to foresee an emergency storage
It recommended that facilities have a central water storage tank with a 2 days water demand capacity.
The selection of the storage reservoir materials largely depends on whether the reservoir is to be placed on the ground or to be elevated on a support structure.
Ground storage reservoirs are normally reinforced concrete or concrete blocks or bricks.
"Elevated reservoirs are normally made out of galvanised pressed steel panels, and placed on steel support structures."
"All other factors being equal, the most economical storage reservoir shape is circular, followed by square and lastly rectangular."
Normally the depth of water should not exceed 5m.
Level ground sites are preferable because they simplify excavation work.
"The design of storage reservoir foundations must be based on proper evaluations of ground It is recommended that reservoirs are provided in standard capacities of 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, The size of the inlet line is determined by the water supply demand requirements of the facility and should have a shut off valve next to the reservoir."
The size of the outlet is also determined by the demand requirements and should be located at least 200 mm above the reservoir bottom.
It should also have a shutoff valve adjacent to the reservoir.
The drain (washout) facilities for cleaning of the reservoir and is located at the bottom of the tank.
Cleaning is done by shutting the main line valve and opening the discharge line.
The reservoir is constructed with a slope towards the drain line to simplify cleaning.
Reservoirs should have an overflow line that can support the maximum anticipated overflow.
The overflow pipes should be at least 50% larger than the inlet pipes and should be well screened and covered.
It should be possible to observe the overflow so that the inlets can
"Manholes and covers are installed to provide an entrance during cleaning, maintenance and repair."
They should be raised higher than the roof level to prevent entry of contaminated surface water.
They should Water level indicators are used to indicate the water level inside the reservoirs.
A depth gauge using a float and wire is usually used.
"The flow into the reservoir may be stopped manually or automatically by a float valve, pressure switch or any other device."
Double orifice valves allow release of air when water is flowing while single orifice valves will allow release of air accumulated at specific points to be released when water starts flowing.
"Large reservoirs should be equipped with internal and external ladders and have external walkways and handrails, especially if they are elevated."
They should be approximately partitioned if the reservoirs exceed 500 m3.
Care must be exercised to ensure that the above aspects are done in accordance with the relevant guidelines and details are produced accordingly.
"Water for drinking, cooking, personal hygiene, medical activities, cleaning and laundry is safe for the purpose intended."
"To ensure adequate disinfection, a contact time of at least 30 minutes should be allowed between the moment the chlorine is added to the water and the moment the water is available for consumption or use."
"The free chlorine residual (the free form of chlorine remaining in the water) after the contact time should be between 0.5 and 1.0 milligrams per litre  in all points of the system, including end-points."
Residual chlorine can be measured with simple equipment (e.g.
Mains supply water may need supplementary chlorination to ensure adequate disinfection and a sufficient level of residual chlorine up to the point of consumption or use.
Stored water may also need supplementary chlorination before use.
Effective disinfection requires that the water has a low turbidity.
"Ideally, median turbidity should be below 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) ."
"However, 5 NTU is the minimum turbidity measurable with simple equipment (turbidity tube), so this level may be used in lowcost settings in practice."
"If turbidity exceeds 5 NTU then the water should be treated to remove suspended matter before disinfection, by sedimentation (with or without coagulation and flocculation) and/or filtration."
"Drinking water quality at a HCF should be routinely monitored for E. coli, total coliforms, residual chlorine, arsenic and fluorides."
"Quality of water for cooking, personal hygiene, medical activities, cleaning and laundry should be monitored for E. coli, total coliforms, residual chlorine and Monitoring reports should be prepared and duly kept on file for seasonal variation review and future  in cases where there is need to correct the water quality design to the HCF."
"Where interventions for improvement of the quality of the water is not possible, the source of water should be decommissioned and search for alternative sources."
The responsibility for monitoring the quality of water used at the HCF is under the HCF in-charge.
"Water Facilities and Access to Water Sufficient water collection points and water-use facilities should be available in the healthcare facility to allow for convenient access to, and use of, water for medical activities, drinking, personal hygiene, food preparation, laundry and cleaning.10 As a guiding principle water should be available within the all the wards and in waiting areas."
"Drinking-water should be provided separately from water provided for handwashing and other purposes, even if it is from the same supply."
Drinking-water may be provided from a piped water system or via a covered container with a tap where there is no piped supply.
Drinking-water points should be clearly marked.
"Basic hygiene measures by staff, patients and carers, handwashing in particular, should not be compromised by lack of water."
Water points should be sufficiently close to users to encourage them to use water as often as required.
"Alternatively, a handwashing basin, soap and a jug of clean water may be placed on a trolley used for ward rounds, to encourage handwashing as often as needed between patient At least two handwashing basins should be provided in wards with more than 20 beds."
"Although less important than handwashing in terms of reducing disease transmission, showering (or other means of washing the body) may be important for the recovery of certain patients, and may be required by staff and carers in contact with infectious patients."
"If piped hot water is available, measures should be taken to avoid the proliferation of bacteria in the water system."
"For this reason, piped water and water from showers should ideally be maintained below 20C Separate showers may be needed for staff and patients, and for both sexes, to ensure that all groups have adequate privacy and safety."
"At least one shower is available for 40 users in patient settings (users include patients, staff and staff and carers staying in the healthcare facility)."
"Laundry facilities, with soap or detergent, hot water and a disinfectant (such as chlorine solution), should be available for inpatient settings."
Operation and Maintenance of the Water Supply System Operation of the water supply system components should be carried out in accordance with the suppliers recommendations.
The maintenance requirements for the water supply components are summarized in the Rain water harvesting system Regular cleaning of the roof catchment surfaces and gutters Trimming of tree branches hanging over the roof catchment to reduce dry leaves and birds droppings falling onto the roof; Drain and clean the tank with clean brooms/brushes Disinfection of the of the tank with chlorine Cleaning should be done quarterly All faults on hand pump boreholes to be repaired by a qualified hand pump mechanic or area service provide whom the HCF can sign a contract with if need be.

"Improved sanitation in health facilities is critical in the preventing the spread of infectious microorganisms found in human faecal material, medical and waste from getting in to contact with people and posing a threat to their health."
Appropriately designed and adequate sanitation facilities/services are critical in the prevention and or minimizes the spread of diseases within the HCFs.
"These guidelines provide for planning for sanitation in HCFs, sanitation options for different levels of health facilities, standards of technical designs and specifications for sanitation facilities including those of people with special needs."
"To provide adequate and appropriate sanitation facilities for management and safe disposal of human waste, domestic solid waste, medical / healthcare waste and waste General Adequacy Criteria for Excreta Disposal Facilities in HCFs Generally, sanitation services in HCFs will be satisfactory and adequate if the following minimum WHO recommends a ratio of one toilet per 20 users and should be used as a planning guideline for inpatient settings."
"At least one shower is available for 40 users in inpatient settings (users include patients, staff and carers staying in the health-care setting)."
"The toilets of those with special needs should be designed appropriately to meet their needs such as ramps for wheel chair, support rails and color lines for the visually impaired."
"In addition, efforts should be made to ensure that the toilets are designed and equipped to respond to social and cultural norms such as provision of water for anal cleansing, lockable doors for privacy and a clear access pathway adequately lit at night."
Toilets should be conveniently located; preferably not more than 30 meters from all users locations for ease of reach.
"In addition, they should have clear path ways that are devoid of any form of obstruction (physical or non-physical) that is toilets must be open for use when needed."
Under no circumstances should the toilet doors be locked preventing access to users except in situations of safety and a key is available at all times.
Toilets should at all times be functional i.e.
Toilets or any other sanitation facility should be utilized for the purpose for which it was intended.
"Functionality of the Sanitation Facility A toilet is considered functional if it is not broken, the toilet hole is not blocked, there should be no cracks or leaks in the toilet structure and water should be available for flush/pour-flush The sanitation facility should be utilized and maintained for the purpose for which it is intended and should not be converted in to any other uses such as storage spaces."
"The sanitation waste disposal facilities should be designed and constructed to ensure that waste or human excreta do not get into contact with people or transmit infectious microorganisms, physical contaminants, or harbor vector or vermin."
"In addition, adequate measures should be put in place to control flies and mosquito breeding in and around toilets."
"The sanitary facilities should be structurally sound without presenting the risk of collapsing, falling posing a risk of"
"To minimize the risk of violence, including sexual violence and or harm toilets should be properly located, with lockable doors (from inside) and access should be adequately lit at night."
"Convenient Hand Washing Facility Close-by A toilet is not complete without a hand washing point with soap, water and adequate drainage."
"All toilet designs should include convenient hand washing facilities so that hand washing after using the toilet can become a routine activity for the patients, visitors, caretakers and healthcare workers."
Hand washing facilities can be located outside toilet stance but within toilet block in order to wash hand after exiting toilet stance.
Wastewater from hand washing should be drained to a sewer or soakaway pits built using rocks/ coarse gravel.
More information on hand hygiene is included in Section 5-4.
Toilets should be designed and built so that they are hygienic to use and do not become centres for disease transmission.
"Surfaces that may be soiled should be of smooth, waterproof and hardwearing material that can be cleaned with water and is resistant to cleaning products."
"In terms of cleaning, the slab is the most important part of a toilet; it should be made of concrete or some other hardwearing and smooth material."
"Other parts of the toilet, such as the superstructure, can be made with cheaper local materials."
"The design of the toilet should include measures to minimize odours, and control the breeding of flies and mosquitoes."
The floors in washrooms should be provided with anti-slippery finishing / tiles and the walls to be tiled for ease of cleaning.
Menstrual Hygiene Wastes Handling Facilities The washroom and/or toilet stances on ladies side of sanitation facilities should contain water and appropriate containers (for primary collection of the used menstrual materials in order to prevent blockages of sewerage pipes or difficulties in desludging pits or septic tanks.
There should be a system for collection and disposal of menstrual wastes after removal from the toilets/ washrooms.
"The waste handling, transportation and disposal practices detailed in Chapter 11 can be applied to menstrual hygiene wastes."
"WASH Facilities should Ensure Infection Prevention and Control Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities should prevent infection and its spread in health care facilities to prevent people catching an infection while receiving health care."

Designing of sanitation facilities should be part of the initial HCF planning.
"However, where sanitation infrastructure and services are inadequate it is equally important to plan for construction of new ones or upgrading the existing facilities."
"As mentioned in the preceding section, two types of toilets are recommended for HCFs depending on the Facility size and catchment population (with future projections); Type of services being offered at a facility; Availability of reliable water supply; IV."

It is important that toilet cisterns work properly all the time.
"If they do not work, the sewage is left in the toilet pan."
Sewage left in toilets will smell bad and will bring flies which can carry diseasecausing germs to people.
"However, the toilet can be flushed by pouring a bucket of water into the pedestal pan."
This should be done every time the toilet is used until the cistern is fixed.
The most important part is the cistern.
"Sometimes the cistern is set behind the wall in a duct or cavity to protect it from vandals.12 Environmental health practitioner manual -TAFE Aboriginal Access and the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services Council,"
Maintenance and hygiene of flush toilets Flush toilets are not typically designed to handle waste on site.
"Instead, their drain pipes are connected to waste conveyance and waste treatment systems.13 For maintenance and hygiene purposes the following practices are recommended: Users of flush toilets should be reminded through a visibly displayed poster that they must flush and leave the toilet clean after use; The cleaners should clean the flush toilet with a toilet brush and detergents; (iii)	 There should be a cleaning schedule that shows the cleaning time and a supervisors verification column that is signed to indicate monitoring for cleanliness; (iv)	 Periodic checks on effective functioning of the flush toilets in the HCF should be carried out to identify any mechanical faults especially the blockage of wastewater flow due to the faulty cistern mechanism; (v)	 Since in many cases flush toilets are located within the buildings, rectification of such faults should be done immediately otherwise flies could be easily attracted within the premises of the HCFs."
"Rectification is also important to avoid bad smell from blocked (vi)	 Bed pans should be immediately cleaned and disinfected after being used by the The amount of water used by conventional flush toilets usually makes up a significant portion of personal daily water usage in HCFs especially those with relatively high numbers of HCWs, patients and carers."
"It is recommended that HCFs should opt for modern low flush toilet designs, which allow the use of much less water per flush that range from 4.5 to 6 liters per flush."
Ventilated Improved Pit Latrines The VIP latrine is an improvement over the simple dry pit latrine.
"The distinctive feature that gives the VIP latrine its name is the vent pipe installed into the pit, which is used to exhaust the foul odour from the pit and control flies ( The national guidelines for water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities  The United Republic of Tanzania, 2017"
The principle is that a continuous flow of air comes in through the superstructure and enters the pit through the hole.
The other advantage of the vent is controlling flies.
Newly-emerging adult flies will try to escape through the vent pipe because the pipe allows sunlight to enter into the pit and flies are photopositive (meaning they move towards light) by nature.
The vent pipe should have an internal diameter of 110150 mm and reach more than 500 mm above the highest point of the roof.
The vent works better in windy areas but where there is not much wind its effectiveness can be improved by painting the pipe black.
It is very important to ensure that the vent pipe is straight and vertical in order to allow as much light as possible to shine down the pipe into the pit and so attract any newly emergent flies up The bottom of the vent pipe should be securely fixed into a hole in the pit cover slab.
The vent pipe should be attached to the wall of the superstructure with steel straps or galvanized steel wire.
"To test the efficacy of the ventilation, a small, smoky fire can be lit in the pit; the smoke should be pulled up and out of the vent pipe and not remain in the pit or the superstructure."
For PVC pipes sandpaper the top of the pipe so there are no sharp edges that will cut the netting.
An alternative is to make a collar from a cut section of pipe and snap this over the mesh.
Aluminium screens with a hole size of 1.21.5 mm have proved to be the most effective.15 Inspect the fly screen regularly at intervals of six months or less.
The slab should have a smooth surface and slope towards the squat hole to provide easy drainage for urine and water used for cleaning the floor.
"The opening or squat hole should not be more than 250 millimetres, so that it is too small for a young child to fall through."
A key hole shape with foot rests is ideal.
Placement of the foot rests ensures that the user is correctly positioned over the hole.
"Foot rests are oval in shape and about 300 millimetres long, 125 millimetres wide and 25 millimetres high."
For the vent pipe to perform efficiently it should be straight without any A Ventilated Improved Pit Latrine Source: WEDC Loughborough
Toilet Features for People with Special Needs Accessible toilets are an absolute necessity for many people living with a disability.
"Accessible toilets are made for wheelchair users, individuals with mobility impairments, people with bowel and/ or bladder conditions, patients with balance issues, grip issues or other conditions that make support rails useful and people with a range of invisible disabilities who also need to use the The following are important features of an accessible toilet: An accessible door way - Doorways of accessible toilets should bewide enough (at least 1m wide) so that wheelchair users can easily roll in and out."
There should beno thresholdobstructing the entrance.
"In addition,the door should always open outwards.This means the door can still be opened easily in an emergency situation; Grab rails are a basic feature of any accessible toilet."
"They provide crucialsupport, stability and balancefor anyone transferring onto the toilet ( A higher toilet seat - For people with reduced mobility,higher toilet seats make it easier to stand up and sit down."
"By raising the seat of an accessible toilet, transfers to/from a wheelchair are also safer asthe seat height is more equal between the two; Low mirrors and sinks - Mirrors and wash hand basins in accessible toiletsshould be placed at a lower height.This makes them useable for anyone seated in a wheelchair; The soap, paper towels, hooks, and toilet paper must all be within reach when seated."
All amenities in an accessible toilet must be within reach for wheelchair users; Easy-to-use tap and bin designs -The tap and bin in an accessible toilet should be an easy-to-use design thatdoesnt require much force and with a closed fist; Space - An accessible toilet has to be spacious enough to turn and manoeuvre in a wheelchair.
"At minimum, this should involve a clear and unobstructed wheelchair turning circle of 1.5 meters in diameter."
Thesink should also have adequate space underneathto roll right up to it in a wheelchair; Signposting - Signposting with a wheelchair icon is especially important so anyone in need of an accessible toiletknows it existsandknows where to find it.
Blind people and people with poor vision need to have special grips and guiding systems (ramps) as well as proper lighting for the poor-sighted people; Wheel chair ramps should be provided at minimum slope of 1:12.
"Water borne toilet (seat type) with grab rails for persons with disabilities with a hand washing facility within Vulnerability and adoptability of sanitation facilities to climate change Climate change is among the major challenges that increase the risk of extreme weather events, such as increase in the strength and frequency of heavy precipitation and floods."
Technologies promoted for improving access to sanitation in HCFs are vulnerable to climate-related threats.
"In places that are susceptible to flooding, the lined pit should be made shallow into the ground and raised above the ground level (Raised VIP latrine)."
This has to be safely contained in well-designed sanitation facilities.
"The lined pits and septic tanks should be designed and constructed with access point for emptying, when vaults are full."
"Safe emptying using mechanized trucks should be practiced on full vaults, at least one week after last user and emptied with workers wearing full PPE."
"When the VIP latrine or septic tank has served its design life, it should be decommissioned/ destroyed after safe emptying of contained faecal sludge."
At least one week should be allowed before the site is redeveloped.
"Good hygiene practices such as hand washing at critical times, bathing regularly, food handling & storage and use of personal protective equipment are crucial in preventing the acquisition and spread of infectious microorganisms at the health facility."
"These hygiene practices/behaviours are often simple, inexpensive and highly effective in preventing the spread of disease among patients, caregivers and healthcare workers."
The outbreak of COVID 19 has further showed how these simple care practices can significantly reduce the risk of transmitting infectious microorganisms especially in a health facility setting.
This chapter gives guidelines for maintaining effective hygiene practices within the health care environment which should be adhered to by all HCFs at the different levels in order to minimize risks of contamination.
"Guidelines on religious practices, hygiene promotion initiatives, education / communication material approaches and communication channels have been provided."
"The objective is to promote personal, hand, instrument, facility hygiene and mortuary hygiene practices at the health facilities."
"The following guidelines should be applied for general body care including healthcare workers, patients and caretakers."
"The hair should be kept short or pinned up, and regularly washed; Finger nails should be short and clean;"
"Artificial nails and nail vanish should not be applied; Beards and moustache should be trimmed short and clean; Pubic hair should be shaved off regularly; The clothes should be freshly laundered before putting them on daily; In case of exposure to blood or body fluids, clothes should be decontaminated before Uniforms should be made of materials easy to be washed, and decontaminated; Tooth brushing at least twice a day; Bathing at least once every day; The uniform material should not allow body fluids to seep through easily."
Hand hygiene is the most effective method of preventing transfer of micro-organisms between personnel and patients within the health care facility.
The purpose is to reduce resident and transient organisms.
"Appropriate hand washing is achieved through using soap, running water and friction."
"Patients, care takers and health workers should be instructed in proper hand washing before eating, after toilet and when soiled."
"Appropriate hand washing is achieved through use of soap, running water and friction."
"Health workers should wash their hands properly before and after handling patients, equipment or Instructions prior to hand washing: Remove all jewellery, wet hands, apply detergent, use enough friction to cover all areas of your hands."
"The steps to be followed while performing antiseptic hand washing are similar to Healthcare facilities should make available alcohol rubs (Alcohol - based rub, Ethanol 70-90%, Isopropyl 60-70%, methanol) at points of care and should conform to the national specifications for alcohol-based hand hygiene products."
The alcohol rub should be kept in secure place in order to avoid risk of accidental or intentional ingestion at the point of care by individual patient.
It should be applied when hands are not visibly soiled in order to decontaminate hands for seconds or until dry and should follow the steps illustrated in
"In case there are, cover them with occlusive waterproof dressing Sleeves must be short to allow scrubbing up to the elbows Keep nails short and clean without nail polish Keep the soap and soap dispensers clean; In case plain soap is used, care should be taken to avoid contamination of the soap and soap dispensers as they may act as reservoirs of bacteria if not cleaned properly between uses."
"Rub palms to palms, fingers interlaced for both hands, continue into rotational rubbing back and forth with clasped fingers of right into left and vice versa ensuring that nails and nail beds are cleaned with a single use disposable scrubbing brush."
The hands should not be scrubbed to avoid skin damage.
The scrubbing procedure should not take less than 5 minutes.
"Rinse off 2nd wash the lather again starting from hands to elbows, may repeat antiseptic wash by giving a final wash to the hands."
"With hands still above, open gown pack into the square off surface and take a cotton hand towel, by placing the picking hand on one opposite side behind the towel, while the other also is kept opposite, as in illustrations below ( Illustration on Steps for Surgical Hand Washing Source: Kagga and Partners - Guidelines for WASH in Healthcare Facilities, 20215.4.1.5."
Drying of Hands and Arms after Surgical Scrubbing The principle of drying hands is to ensure removal of excess water and reduction of bacterial count of all transient micro-organisms.
Hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene.
"Wet hands have high bacterial count and lead to dryness, cracked skin and increased latex allergies, for all drying purposes single use cotton towels are referred to here."
"The opposite side of the towel should dry the corresponding hand by blotting the skin dry in a corkscrew motion beginning with the fingers up to the elbow, while the other side will be used to blot the hand that picked the towel from the pack, following the same process."
"However, if 2 towels are provided discard the first, and using the 2nd towel."
"Illustration for hand drying using a towel Source: Kagga & Partners - Guidelines for WASH in Healthcare Facilities, 2021 Communal towels have been recognized as sources of cross-infection and Disposable paper towels or single use (reusable) cotton towels are The use of hot air driers is not recommended and should be discouraged"
"Hand washing facilities including low cost models (hand washing basins, running water, lever taps among others) should be made available in various locations of the facilities as listed below:At stations near the main entrance/gate of the HCF Medical examination rooms Within or at the entry / exit of the toilet Breast feeding / nutrition corners And any other convenient location determined by HCF In-charge These should be regularly serviced and maintained to ensure constant availability."
Healthcare facilities should ensure adequate hand washing facilities in order to practice effective hand hygiene.
"WHB within the mortuary and As deemed necessary by the Specifications for Hand washing facilities in HCFs Should be made of non-porous material, round shape inside with dimensions of 25cm by 35cm depth and without overflow Should be of elbow, foot or automatic operating taps, u. PVC traps Should be a wall-mounted basin fixed at 120cm above floor Should be soap dispenser (manual or automatic) Should be a centered feed hand towel dispenser Hand drying material should be a disposable paper towel Both hot and cold water should be provided Should be used when hands are visibly clean Should be a round black/blue pedal bin of 12 litters (340mm (height) x 270mm (diameter)"
Wheel chair accessible hand wash basin which is wall mounted with dimensions of 510mm (length) by 685mm (width).
The main features of a scrub sink include: Digital timer - is used to ensure that the proper amount of time is spent on hand hygiene before entering the operating room.
Faucet - is an important feature of a scrub set because it delivers the water for the hand scrubbing process.
"It should offer non-aerated, consistent water flow with either shower head or laminae properties."
Soap dispenser - a proper dose of surgical scrub chemistry is also important when selecting a scrub sink.
"The soap is dispensed by a hand pump, foot pump, knee operation or infrared methods."
Water control - water control on a scrub sink may be operated by hand or automated.
"Station / bay - scrub sinks maybe constructed with one, two or three stations at which multiple members or staff can wash their hands at the same time."
The distance from the ground at which the scrub sink is mounted is critical because it determines the level of decontamination and sterilization.
"Critical Moments of Hand Hygiene in HCFs Hand Hygiene in Patient Handling Care has to be taken before, during and after handling or touching a patient, and in handling food for therapeutic care."
"Critical moments of hand hygiene (5 moments of hand hygiene) during patient care are illustrated in these critical moments as they can easily contaminate their hands at different occasions such as lifting a patient, wound dressing, taking a patients pulse, blood pressure, or oral temperature, touching a patients hand, shoulder or groin."
"There should be sufficient and functional, hand hygiene facilities to ensure health care workers, caregivers and patients can carry out hand hygiene at all five key moments."
There should be cadres designated to monitor hand washing practices of the visitors to the Critical Moments of Hand Hygiene in health Care Facilities Source: Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care
"Other Critical Moments of Hand Hygiene The other critical moments for proper hand washing in HCFs environment include: Before entering and leaving inpatient wards or any working area of the health facility Before and after feeding a patient; After contact with inanimate surfaces and objects in the immediate vicinity of the Before and after serving food; After visiting the toilet; When hands are visibly dirty, or soiled with blood or other body fluids; Before putting on gloves and immediately after removing gloves; Before and after caring for any patient."
"Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette is a standard precaution that should be applied by all patients, visitors and HCWs to contain respiratory secretions (e.g."
Persons with respiratory symptoms should apply the following source control measures: Cover their nose and mouth when coughing/sneezing with tissue or mask.
"If no tissues are available, cough or sneeze into the inner elbow rather than hand; Do not spit in environment (use tissue instead); Dispose of used tissues and masks; Avoid shaking hands when sick; and Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions."
"HCFs should promote respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette by: Educating HCF staff, patients, family members, and visitors on the importance of containing respiratory droplet/ aerosol and secretions to prevent the transmission of infectious disease (e.g."
If you have respiratory symptoms (e.g.
Cleaning is the single most step in making a medical device ready for re-use.
Further processing (disinfection and sterilization) of equipment that does not include cleaning can fail because microorganisms can be protected inside the residual organic matter.
"In practice, cleanliness is based on visual inspection, whether the instrument is visibly clean."
Disinfection is the process destroying or inhibiting disease producing microorganisms outside the body.
It is the first step in processing equipment that has been in contact with blood and body fluids but it is also used for items that cannot undergo the sterilization process.
"High-Level Disinfection (HLD) High level disinfection is the process that eliminates all microorganisms except some bacterial endospores from inanimate objects by boiling, steaming or the use of chemical disinfectants."
"Sterilization is a process that eliminates all microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites) including bacterial endospores from inanimate objects by high-pressure steam (autoclave), dry heat (oven), chemical sterilants or radiation."
"The guidelines on instrument hygiene processes are presented in Guidelines on Instrument Hygiene Process Soak in 0.5% chlorine solution for 10 All contaminated instruments and Soap, scrub brush, clean water Scrub and remove all tissue, blood, and decontamination and before further processing (sterilization or HLD) or Steam (autoclave at 121C, 106k."
The objective of these guidelines is to minimize the risk of disease transmission and promote good hygienic practices in the processing of food at the health facility.
"Cleanliness and safe food preparation and storage practices are critical to: Preventing outbreaks of food borne illness among patients; Minimizing microbiologic contamination of food by using appropriate food handling techniques during the preparation of food; and Protecting food from contamination by insects, rodents and moisture."
This becomes more important in the kitchen environment where the tendency for infection is high due to the presence of patients suffering from various sicknesses and infections.
"Keep floor and working tops clean and dry Food waste and other rubbish should be put in containers that can be closed and these must be of appropriate construction, kept in sound condition, be easy to clean and where necessary, to disinfect."
It is recommended that the management of the health care facility ensures regular supervision over the HCFs kitchens.
"It is recommended that in health facilities where patients food is prepared by relatives there is access to proper hygienic equipment (cooking stoves, water, sinks, etc)."
Educate relatives in food Food Handling and Preparation Food handlers should be trained in basic food safety.
"Soap and water should be available at all times during food preparation and handling, to ensure that hand washing is convenient."
"If kitchen staff and carers have colds, influenza, diarrhoea, vomiting or throat and skin infections, or have suffered from diarrhoea and vomiting within the last 48 hours, they should not handle food unless it is packaged."
"All infections should be reported, and sick staff should not be penalized for reporting infections."
Food-preparation premises should be kept meticulously clean.
"Surfaces used for food preparation should be washed with detergent and safe water and then rinsed, or wiped with a clean cloth that is washed frequently."
"Scraps of food should be disposed of rapidly, because they are potential reservoirs for bacteria, and can attract insects and rodents."
"Refuse should be kept in covered bins and disposed of Eating utensils should be washed with hot water and detergent immediately after each use, and then air dried."
"The sooner utensils are cleaned, the easier they are to wash. Drying cloths should not be used, as they can spread contamination."
"Food should be protected from insects, rodents and other animals, which frequently carry pathogenic organisms and are a potential source of contamination of food."
"Separation of food and equipment Separate equipment and utensils, such as knives and cutting boards, should be used for handling raw foods or they should be washed and sanitized in between uses."
Food should be stored in containers to avoid contact between raw and prepared foods.
"Raw meat, poultry and seafood should be separated from other foods."
"To ensure this happens, soups and stews should be brought to the boil and meat should be heated until juices are clear, not pink."
Cooked food to be served should be kept hot (more than 60C) before serving.
Processed food stuffs should not be used beyond its expiry date.
Expired food stuffs should be disposed of in a safe manner that is not accessible to persons and animals.
"Cooked or perishable food should not be left at room temperature for more than two hours, and should be prepared or supplied fresh each day."
"All food should be kept covered to protect Non-perishable foods should be stored safely in a closed, dry, well-ventilated store and protected from rodents and insects."
"They should not be stored in the same room as pesticides, disinfectants or any other toxic chemicals."
Containers that have previously held toxic chemicals should not be used for storing foodstuffs.
Bought food should not be used beyond its expiry date.
"Food should be protected from insects, rodents and other animals, which frequently carry pathogenic organisms and are a potential source of contamination of food."
"Only safe water should be used for food preparation, handwashing and cleaning."
"Feeding centres and distribution sites should include access to safe water for drinking, as well as clean water and soap for handwashing; Wash hands and sterilize equipment and utensils, clean and disinfect the work surface Wash equipment and utensils thoroughly with soap and hot water if sterilization is not Wash your hands before preparing the food and before feeding a child."
"Wash the Feed baby using a clean cup and spoon, never use a bottle as this is difficult to clean and might cause baby to get diarrhoea because of contamination; Cook food thoroughly or re-heat it thoroughly; Keep food at safe temperatures; and Wash hands before and after touching the baby or breast feeding."
Other Food Service Hygiene Practices Other food hygiene practices are listed below: Wash hands before handling food or utensils and wear plastic gloves when appropriate.
"Wash hands and clean nails after: Having contact with unclean equipment and work surfaces, soiled clothing and After having contact with patient care area, and patient, family member Hands and fingers should be kept away from hair and face where food contaminant organisms can be picked up and transmitted to food."
"Tongs, forks and spoons should be used when preparing foods to minimize hand contact."
Cracked and chipped crockery should be discarded.
Use different utensils between raw food and cooked food; Food should not be tasted with ladle or spoon used in food preparation.
"Utensils used for tasting should be thoroughly washed between tastes, or disposable utensils used; Work areas, surfaces and utensils must be cleaned between different preparation Do not cut or prepare food on the ground  use worktops Food service staff must have clean fingernails."
Wearing rings and nail polish should be
Staff suffering from diarrhoea should be immediately removed from handling food and contact with patients until all symptoms are fully over for 2448 hours.
"There should be mandatory screening of those preparing food for patients; Clean up worktops and equipment properly before, during and after food preparation; Serve food as soon as possible after cooking as bacteria are developing quickly in the hot and humid climate (not longer than two hours after preparation, store and serve food at the correct temperature.)"
"If no refrigerator is available, serve the meal, and do not keep the leftover meal."
Use correct handling and storage techniques for garbage containers and washing containers after emptying; Do not allow any animals into the kitchen at any time; Routine fumigation must be carried out for eradication of rodents and insects that would contaminate and destroy food stuffs; Keep food away from flies and other insects; The kitchen should be far from waste storage and disposal areas and toilets.
"It is crucial for HCFs to have bathrooms commiserate to the HCF bed and staffing capacity at a ratio of patient per bathroom as recommended in A proper bathroom within the HCF should have the following basic qualities: Constant cold and warm water Separate male and female bathrooms Adequate lighting for safe use at night Clean and regularly maintained Hand wash basins with running water, lever taps and a mirror Waste bins for proper menstrual hygiene management for ultimate treatment and disposal in gazetted areas"
This should be done after making announcements over the radio for the corpses to be claimed.
The HCFs should endevour to keep on file as much detail as possibly available about the deceased in case of claims that may arise 5.10.
"Religious practices Where piped water supply is available, bidet showers should be installed in the toilets to cater for religions that use water for anal cleansing."
"Where piped water is not available, use of water containers such as jerry cans or bottles are Improving hygiene is heavily influenced by the existence of appropriate and adequate facilities coupled with tailor made hygiene promotion initiatives that are cognizant of the audience"
"These may include education levels, prevailing traditional and cultural norms, duration of stay at the health facility a strong desire to heal and leave the others."
The insights derived from audience participation can provide individual audience views of the benefits /motivations and preferred channels of communication of safer hygiene practices.
"The developed messages should have a clear call to action and be placed in appropriate channels to effectively reach the key three audiences (patients, care givers and health workers)."
Availability of adequate financial and human resource to implement the hygiene promotion initiatives is also critical for successful hygiene promotion.
"Information Education and Communication Material Information education and communication (IEC) material to include the following approaches as Posters Placed at Eye Level of Hygiene Facility Points Posters should be developed to communicate simple messages to the HCF audiences especially patients, care givers and visitors."
The posters should be developed in consultation with the intended audiences.
It is important to note that the posters are less likely to change sanitation and hygiene behaviors on their own but as a part of multiple behavior change interventions.
"Images should be realistic and true to scale, clearly showing the chosen action."
Materials should be pre-tested locally to ensure the pictures and texts convey the correct message.
"The posters should be displayed at eye level in strategic places (hygiene facility points), where they can be viewed by the maximum number of intended audiences."
"For instance, the floor between the toilet and the hand washing sink can be given a treatment of brightly colored arrow-shaped stickers or molds directed towards the sinks."
This is intended to produce the notion that people should follow the arrows and use the sinks after having used the toilet.
Hygiene Promotion Session Guide What are the WASH practices that can help improve our health?
"This is affordable, effective and sustainable because it is long lasting compared to posters."
"Facility user Instructions to Promote Appropriate use and Maintenance of With the rapidly evolving technologies the sanitation and hygiene facilities used in HCFs such as flushing toilets, water borne hand washing facilities, soap dispensers among others are new to various HCF clients."
As such it is important that clear instructions with the help of diagrams on how to use these facilities should developed and displayed to foster proper and effective use of these facilities.
"The sinks are for washing your hands only  do not use for washing clothes, bed Lenin or scrubbing your shoes which may damage the basin; (iii)	 Use toilet paper."
"Do not use other materials such as papers, stones which may block (iv)	 Do not dump sanitary material into the toilet."
The best way is to ask the people for whom they were designed for their opinion concerning some of the following quality factors.
"Comprehension: Ensure that the people understand the main point(s) and that every image, illustration and words used are easily understandable by the audience."
Relevance: Ensure that people feel that the materials were made for them.
The information should be in their own HCF lives even outside the HCF.
Noticeability: The materials should attract peoples attention and easily noticeable.
Acceptability: the material should not be offensive to the culture.
"Knowledge, attitude or belief change: The exposure to the material used should aim at imparting knowledge to learn new practices and should motivate them to act accordingly or do something."
People should be prompted after being exposed to the materials whether they think that they have learned anything new or it motivated them Strong and weak points: Respondents should be asked about the best things about the materials and if they had to change something what would it be.
"When Conducting Focus Group Discussions In conducting focus group discussions, the following should be taken into consideration: Make sure that everyone can see or hear the material or media you are assessing; Rotate the order in which you present different versions of the materials in each focus Ask for a general reaction first before you start asking about specific details; If you need to decide between several graphics, show people the pictures by themselves without the text and ask what message they think the graphics convey; After showing all versions, you can ask people to rank them in order of preference; Encourage critical feedback if only positive feedback is being given."
You may not need to address all the feedback you receive: some may be irrelevant.
Pretesting the materials with more people can help you to identify which issues are coming up repeatedly and are worth your attention.
"Communication Channels Small ward/group meetings Small ward/group meetings of about 2 to 15 people shall be conducted for sanitation and Conduct sanitation and hygiene promotion small group meetings of patients and care givers upon admission to facilitate the adoption and reinforcement of positive sanitation and hygiene perceptions, beliefs, expectations, and behavior patterns.The meetings should be conducted for all the new patients and care givers as part of the patient admission process and during triage waiting time for outpatients."
Subsequent follow up meetings should be held by the ward in charges on a weekly basis by the most senior (longest stay) care giver in every ward.
"Long-term care givers, facility hygiene and promotion staff should conduct demonstrations on the use of sanitation and hygiene facilities such as the flush toilet, hand washing facilities and Health workers, long-term care givers, facility hygiene and promotion staff should conduct one on one session in the ward, during dump dusting and ward rounds."
"This section of the guideline has been put in place and is to be applied in conjunction with the National Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines 2013, which was very comprehensively put together and was also designed to be used alongside the Policies and Procedures MOH 2005, IPC MOH 2004, PEP for HIV, Hepatitis Band C, Infection Safety and Healthcare Waste Management, TB Infection Control (TB-IC) guidelines among others, as stipulated."
"Precisely, IPC is the establishment and implementation of policies and procedures and the education and monitoring of staff adherence to preventive procedures to reduce infection among patients, staff and visitors."
"The main objectives of a safe and reliable IPC is to: To ensure patient and healthcare worker safety through ensuring adherence to proper infection control protocols; To upgrade and develop WASH structures complimentary to IPC; To build IPC and WASH capacity among staff, patients and caregivers."
"Inappropriate provision and use of WASH facilities can directly affect human health, the environment and society in various ways including but not limited to: Effects on access to healthcare; Compromised nutritional care to prevent/control infection."
All forms of disease can be transmitted within healthcare settings hence generally referred to as Health-Care Associated Infections (HCAI).
"Modes of Disease Transmission The various modes of transmission resulting from inappropriate use of WASH are but not limited to: Spread through body fluids or blood; Contaminated objects (instruments, equipment, surfaces); Through contaminated water."
Composition of the IPC Committee Recommended composition of the IPC committees at the different levels of the HCFs is presented Senior Microbiologist/Surgeon/Physician
"All the other staff are members of the committee It is recommended that the Environmental Health (Health Inspectorate) of each healthcare facility as well as the assigned community shall be responsible for ensuring compliance of the guidelines and plan frequent in-service training programmes for staff, patients, visitors and society as in the PILS (Performance Improvement through Learning on Sanitation), this will be used to teach good practices, change bad habits, and demonstrate new equipment or procedures."
"At National level the technical working group in collaboration with and the administrative bodies at all levels such as may be identified as lacking appropriate representation, shall appoint an equivalent substitute or restructure the existing employment hierarchy in order to fill up the gaps and enhance sufficient service delivery."
All HCWs should be trained to.
"It is important for healthcare workers to also provide education to the caregivers on IPC measures so that they are best able to protect the patient and themselves, other patients and healthcare workers from"
"Without going into the details of the other categories, the numbers captured are way below the required capacity as critical staff in patient care without considering other multiple tasks rendered let alone working long hours with the subsequent negative effects."
Healthcare associated infections have been identified as a major challenge of modern medicine and remain a major health concern around the globe.
Hands of health care workers are potential vehicles for transmission of pathogenic organisms within the health care environment.
"Whereas hand washing is widely accepted as the one most effective measure in prevention of HCAIs, between health personnel and patients within the HCF, yet the practice per say before and after patient examination bare very significant differences across the globe amongst the various categories of medical cadres, being found highest among trainees especially nurses, and remarkably high over 90 percent across all staff especially after contact with blood, its products Health care workers dont underscore the significance of hand washing though they tend to practice suboptimal levels of compliance, majorly washing after patient care than before."
To advocate for professional capacity building so as to improve service delivery
"Needs assessment for WASH There are many people involved in the provision of WASH services from planning, construction to maintenance but health workers, technicians, operators and facility administrators are considered the front-line WASH workers without whom or if inadequately trained and not undertaking their daily tasks effectively, access to WASH services and facilities will be restricted, reduced or even broken down at worst."
"Another group of health worker who are crucial are Village health Teams (VHTs) who are trained to promote preventive health care services, under take community outreach activities, conduct house to house visits and provide important information, knowledge and skills on important health related topics grouped into three areas i.e."
"Disease prevention and control III)	 Hygiene and environmental sanitation Health-care Practices Related to WASH The health-care practices related to WASH include but not limited to; Excreta disposal - they provide information and guidance on how human excreta can be safely managed and disposed of, through appropriate use of available sanitary facilities; Water supply safety measures  They relay information regarding contaminated water as a major cause of transmission of water borne diseases that cause diarrhoea; III)	 Control of rodents and vectors - by teaching possible methods of control and IV)	 Delivery of Covid 19 preventive messages to families and the community; Food hygiene and safety measures; VI)	 Reporting of deaths in communities to district health teams for follow up."
"VHTs promote all these recommended practices by ensuring that they are implemented at household level, in communities through involvement of associations."
"Borrowing from Ethiopia, there are Health Development Armies which are organized groups of families that help promote health activities and behaviours among families."
"HEWs facilitate the establishment of these teams and collaborate with HCFs to provide trainings for the team Also, in Ethiopia are private operators who play an important role as frontline workers in making WASH services accessible to communities, doing works ranging from providing household treatment chemicals, sanitary pads, soap, hired technicians for maintenance services and minor"
"Facilitation, practice and initiating sustainable change to improve WASH services requires a full understanding of the existing situation, the barriers to improvement and the available resources."
Commitment for change should come from the communities - change should not be imposed.
Frontline workers should be trained to attain a specific managerial skill that renders the process of facilitation.
Health Workers Daily Routines Health worker practices are intertwined among their responsibilities to patients.
"They are tailored to meet the unique needs of patients and communities served, though they tend to depend on the various factors such as, education, training, lived experience, experience working with specific populations and vulnerabilities, the prevailing circumstances."
Address social determinants of health; Reporting damages to WASH equipment for Maintenance; Conducting research and surveillance for improvement; Involvement in administrative activities pertaining to WASH; Participation in community engagements; Lifting patients from various positions Infection control practices by health workers are grouped into standard and transmission -based precautions.
Standard based precautions are those that should be applied to all patients at all times while transmission-based precautions are those used on patients known to be infected or colonized with a highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens.
"With the advent of Covid 19 generally the following Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were developed and others intensified, benefits are evident even in other communicable diseases, therefore the practices are encouraged to continue."
"Keeping a distance between persons of not less than 2Meters Wearing of a facial mask completely covering the nose and mouth Regular washing of hands for not less than 20sec or use of alcohol-based sanitizers Not touching delicate body parts (Mouth, Nose, Eyes) Health care workers are to wear long sleeved gowns or aprons depending on activity or Robust hand hygiene to be emphasized at all level of service All HCWs to use PPEs to mitigate contamination from non-intact skin and body All persons to cover nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing All persons everywhere to perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory No spitting in open places HCWs to limit patient movements within the institutions etc."
"Other practices generally conducted include but not limited to: Having contact with unclean equipment and work surfaces, soiled After having contact with patient care area, and patient, family Work areas, surfaces and utensils must be cleaned between different Do not prepare trays, swabs or medicinal preparations on the ground Wearing rings and nail polish during working hours should be discouraged; Staff suffering from highly communicable diseases should be immediately Clean up worktops and reusable equipment properly before, and after use, whenever applicable sterilize; Use correct handling and storage techniques for all medicines and Do not allow any animals into the healthcare facility; Routine fumigation must be carried out for eradication of rodents and insects that would be a source contamination and destruction; Use appropriate equipment for storage and carriage of instruments and medicines to control contamination."
"Health care waste management (HCWM) is an integral part of hygiene within a HCF and proper management is essential to prevention and control of nosocomial ( Poor management of health-care waste exposes health-care workers, waste handlers and the community to infections, toxic effects and injuries."
"There is also a potential for spreading drugresistant microorganisms from health-care facilities into the environment through poor healthcare waste management (WHO, 2015a)."
"Sharps and, more specifically, needles are considered the most hazardous category of healthcare waste for health-care workers and the community at large, because of the risk of needlestick injuries which carry a high potential for infection ."
"The waste management processes include: HCW management is intended for minimizing waste generation, proper collection, storage, transportation, proper treatment of the hazardous wastes and final disposal."
About 85% of the waste produced by health-care providers is comparable to domestic waste and usually called non-hazardous or general health-care waste.
"It comes mostly from the administrative, kitchen and housekeeping functions of health-care facilities and may also include packaging waste and waste generated during construction and maintenance of health-care buildings."
"The remaining 15% of health-care waste is regarded as hazardous and can pose a number of health and environmental risks, ."
"Human tissues, organs or fluids; body parts; foetuses; unused blood Pharmaceuticals that are expired or no longer needed; items contaminated by, or containing, pharmaceuticals."
"Non-hazardous or general health-care waste Waste that does not pose any specific biological, chemical, radioactive or Sundries for Waste Management The various categories of waste are to be segregated into lined foot pedalled, colour coded containers of sizes ranging between 15 liters to 360 liters depending on the scope of work at the point of generation, in the colours black, yellow, red and brown ( The color-coded waste segregation systems should be followed and maintained from point of generation to the disposal site."
"Waste Sources and Generation Points in HCFs Depending on the size, complexity and specialty of a facility, waste is majorly generated in the compound, at all points of care, service centers, sanitary facilities, to mention a few, its therefore necessary for management to plan for the appropriate supplies in sorts and sizes depending on the traffic, or load, nature of waste and quantity or volume."
Patient flow streams and waste generation organogram in HCF Healthcare waste is generated from both public and private healthcare facilities.
"Healthcare waste facilities can be classified as major or minor sources depending on the volume of healthcare waste generated as follows: Major sources: National / teaching / specialist Minor sources: Small private laboratories, health centres, bone setting centres, tattoo centres, acupuncture The amount and composition of healthcare waste generated by healthcare facilities depends on waste management system, type of healthcare establishments, the number of patients treated on a daily basis and the level of complexity specialization of the healthcare facility Waste minimization is the most preferred approach to reducing negative impacts of health care also be implemented at the procurement stage including considering green purchasing and adopting inventory management strategies."
Estimations carried out during the national assessment can only give an indication of total volumes collected but are not accurate.
Waste Segregation / Sorting The correct segregation of health-care waste is the responsibility of the healthcare provider and/ or patient and caregiver who produces each waste item.
"Segregation should be carried out by the producer of the waste as close as possible to its place of generation, which means segregation should take place in a medical area, at a bedside, in an operating theatre or laboratory by nurses, physicians and technicians."
"If classification of a waste item is uncertain, as a precaution it should be placed into a container used for hazardous healthcare waste.17 Proper segregation must follow standardized procedures to reduce the risks of infecting health care workers, clients and community."
It should also enable use of the most efficient treatment procedures for each waste stream.
"The following guidelines apply to HCW Segregation: Segregation of HCW should consist of separating the different waste streams basing on the type of treatment and cost benefits of the method of disposal; Segregation shall take place at the source or at the site of generation (bedside in the ward, Operation Theatre, Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, or any other room or ward in the health care facility where the waste is generated); Segregation of HCW practices should provide colour-coded waste bins specifically designated for each category of waste."
"In the absence of color coded bins, however, labeling can be used as an alternative; Maintain a clean and dry waste storage area and environment at the facility; and Ensure waste is properly stored in a secured area to mitigate exposure to the patients Education and training must be provided to all staff who are responsible for both segregation and collection of waste."
"Recommended Colour Coding It is recommended that segregation is done following the color-coding system in the Non-hazardous wastes bin Black for general wastes like packaging materials, paper, leftover food, plaster of Paris (POP), needle wrappings Hazardous wastes bin Yellow for infectious wastes sharps such as surgical blades, needles, broken glass and radioactive materials."
Colour coded bins with respective bin liners with posters placed above each bin to guide on the type of waste Health Care Waste Packaging The following guidelines should be included in packaging.
Infectious wastes should be contained from the point of origin to the point of treatment where it is rendered non-infectious.
The packaging should be appropriate for the type of waste involved.
Liquid infectious waste should be placed in capped or tightly stoppered bottles or flasks and large quantities may be placed in containment tanks.
"Solid or semisolid waste should be placed in durable, tear resistant plastic bags."
The following recommendations should be observed: Do not load bags beyond their weight or volume capacity; Keep bags away from contact with sharp objects; Consider double bagging to ensure tear-resistance.
"There should be special packaging characteristics for some treatment techniques: incineration requires combustible containers, and steam sterilization requires packaging materials such as low-density plastics that allow steam penetration and"
Collection within the Healthcare Facility Collection times should be fixed and appropriate to the quantity of waste produced in each area of the healthcare facility.
General waste should not be collected at the same time or in the same trolley as infectious or other hazardous wastes.
Waste bags and sharps containers should be filled to no more than three quarters full.
"Once this level is reached, they should be sealed ready for collection."
Plastic bags should never be stapled but may be tied or sealed with a plastic tag or tie.
Replacement bags or containers should be available at each waste-collection location so that full ones can immediately be replaced.
"Waste bags and containers should be labelled with the date, type of waste and point of generation to allow them to be tracked through to disposal."
"Where possible, weight should also be routinely recorded."
"Anomalies between time at one location can show up differences in recycling opportunities, or problems such as poor segregation and diversion of waste for unauthorized reuse."
"Collection should be daily for most wastes, with collection timed to match the pattern of waste generation during the day."
"Visitors arriving later in the day will bring with them an increase in general waste, such as newspapers and food wrappings; therefore, the optimum time for general and recyclable waste collection would be after visitors have departed."
"In comparison with this general type of medical area, a theatre would generate a high proportion of potentially infectious waste and could have several collections during the day to fit in with the schedule of operations."
"The following guidelines should be adhered to in waste storage: In each health care unit where HCW is generated, an adequate place shall be dedicated for storing HCW bags, bins or containers."
Health care facilities below level three should store no materials other than yellow bag waste.
Highly infectious waste and anatomical waste (except heavy metals and effluent waste) should be disposed of immediately.
Properly treated waste can be stored up to maximum of one week.
Additional guidelines for highly infectious waste should be adhered to like in the case of The designated central storage facility shall be located within the HCF premises close to the treatment unit but away from food storage or food preparation areas.
The designated central storage facility should be large enough to contain all the hazardous HCW produced by the with any maintenance or breakdown of the treatment unit.
"The designated central storage facility shall be totally enclosed and secured from The designated central storage facility shall be inaccessible to animals, insects and vii)	 The designated central storage facility shall be easy to clean and disinfect and shall have an impermeable hard-standing base, good water supply, drainage and ventilation."
All highly infectious waste (red bags) from isolation wards should be Infectious waste should be stored for a minimum of 2 days if not treated The waste should be packaged securely enough to ensure containment of the waste and to prevent penetration by rodents and vermin.
Limited access to the storage area is recommended.
"The universal biological hazard symbol should be posted on the storage area door, and waste containers."
Containers for bio-hazardous material should be a distinctive red colour.
The following guidelines should be followed in waste handling: All HCW or disposal of medical equipment shall be disposed of at the point of use by the person who used the item.
In case the used equipment is found when not disposed of or handed over to another person for disposal the one who finds it or given the responsibility of disposing it of should do it.
Carts and recyclable containers that are used repeatedly for transport should be disinfected after each use.
Single-use containers should be destroyed as part of the 8.11.
Transportation of Waste Transport to Central Storage The following guidelines should be followed during transportation of HCW to the central storage The waste collection trolley should be easy to load and unload.
Containers should be covered with lids during storage and transport.
Carts should be used for transporting bags of infectious waste within the facility.
"Transport to Final Disposal Site When the waste is to be moved to final disposal site, special handling or packaging is necessary to keep bags intact and to ensure containment of the waste."
"The following procedures should Single-bagged waste and containers of sharps and liquids should be placed within a rigid or semi-rigid container such as a bucket, box, or carton lined with plastic bags."
Containers should be covered with lids during transportation.
"When transporting plastic bags of infectious waste, care should be taken to prevent Infectious waste should not be compacted before treatment."
"Infectious waste should be transported in closed, leak-proof dumpsters or trucks when The waste should be placed in rigid or semi-rigid, leak-proof containers before being vii)	 In case off-site transportation is required to treat hazardous HCW at treatment facilities, NEMA through the local Government shall approve the off-site transportation plan before any transportation occurs."
"Methods of Waste Treatment and Disposal The choice of waste treatment or disposal technology shall be selected from the available current technologies that should have the following characteristics: Most reliable, affordable and sustainable technology in accordance with the technical, human and financial resources of each HCF; and Minimizes the immediate public health risks associated with HCWM with the lowest impact on the environment."
"Methods of HCW treatment and disposal Steam treatment of waste at high temperature and pressure for sufficient amount of time for sterilization Chemical disinfection is the preferred treatment for liquid infectious wastes, but it can also be used in treating solid A cabinet-type small medical waste shredder equipped with cutting blades reduces the size and volume of medical waste up to 50 percent, while the industrial type for high volume waste has either a small vertical steam sterilizer or a big autoclave incorporated to provide sterilization together with the shredder."
"Using appropriate cleaning material, remove all organic matter once instruments are disinfected and cleaned through a four-bucket system, autoclave for sterilization and"
"Containers are filled with three quarters full with hazardous waste, materials such as cement mortar, bituminous sand or plastic foam is used to fill the container."
"When cupping material is dry, the container is buried or land filled Heat created through conduction, convection or thermal radiation is applied to the waste without applying steam."
"The advantage here is, treated waste is dry and generally unrecognizable and is generally easier A furnace of Masonry or concrete, refractory material and metals waste thermally decomposes in the first chamber, an oxygen-poor (pyrolytic chamber) which operates at 800-900o."
"C. In the second chamber, the gases produced in the first chamber are burnt at high temperature (o."
"C (which is the minimum requirement specified in the European Unions waste incineration Directive 2000/76/EC, additional energy should be provided The advantage here is it disinfects very effectively, reduces waste volume by approximately 95 percent and has fewer toxic emissions and odours."
Waste is placed on a fixed grate and burning is maintained by natural flow of air operating at a temperature of less than 300o.
C. may need to add kerosene or similar fuel to maintain combustion.
The advantage here is that burning efficiency is of 90-95 percent and reduces waste volume by approximately 80% and disinfects effectively.
"Without proper operation and maintenance practices, air pollution can occur, including emission of some Unused or expired products are returned to the product supplier or manufacturer for proper disposal or reuse."
"It has no significant environmental impact and its a good method to use for expired or used pharmaceutical, medical or other Micro-organisms are added to the waste to it breakdown."
It is primarily used for domestic and yard waste and it has no significant environmental impact Burial of waste in a pit.
"Access to the pit should be limited and the pit should be at least lined with clay to prevent ground water pollution and 1.5m above Municipal solid waste landfills are able to receive household and industrial solid waste, non-hazardous waste, construction and demolition debris."
"Around 90% of the waste is liquid, which will soak away into the ground."
These are primarily anaerobic processes though some aerobic decomposition will take place in the upper layers.
The waste should not be treated with chemical disinfectants like chlorine before being disposed of because these chemicals destroy the microorganisms that are important for biological decomposition.
"As the waste decomposes, pathogens will be destroyed as well, though some, including eggs, are more resilient than others."
"At present there are little data on how long it will take for all pathogens and eggs to die, so it is recommended that 2 years be allowed to pass before reopening."
The top should be closed by a lockable hatch and a vent pipe installed to ensure that the generated gases can escape and air can get in.
"The pit should be closed off with a concrete slab to reduce the risks of attracting vectors such as flies, mosquitoes and rodents."
It is essential that the organic waste be covered with the lid immediately after disposal to avoid attracting insects and rodents.
"In the very early stages of an emergency, the slab can still be made of wood, but it has to be replaced rapidly by a concrete Placenta Pit Pre-construction Planning Decide on the purpose of the pits Pits can be used for pathological waste and organic waste such as food; Non-infectious waste can be composted separately if facilities exist; Reserving the pits for pathological waste alone will extend their useful life."
Decide on the number and capacity of pits required Two pits are recommended.
This means that the second one is available immediately when the first is filled and avoids the facility being left without any disposal option.
"A conservative estimate for calculating the volume required is that each placenta and associated liquid will have one liter of volume, but that 90% is liquid that will eventually soak away."
"For a circular pit of 1 m diameter, each usable meter of depth has the capacity for 500 placentas."
Hence a pit of 3.5 meters depth will have 3 m of usable depth and 0.5 m of free space.
This will be able to take  placentas (4 placentas per day for a year) even if there is no loss of liquid.
"Assuming 90% loss, this can be sustained for several years."
"Even if there is only slow loss of liquid (4 months for 90% to leach into soil), a pit of this size will take 10 placentas per day for over 6 years before it fills up."
"As a rule of thumb, two pits, each with the capacity for 1 year without loss of liquid are needed, or one pit with the capacity for 2 years."
Having two pits may also allow for pits to be reused once enough time has elapsed for degradation to reduce the volume of waste.
A minimum time of 1 year is recommended before reusing a pit.
Material should not be removed from a pit unless at least two years have elapsed to allow all pathogens and Any material removed from placenta pits should be handled with PPE unless it has been tested and found to be free of pathogens.
This may be part of a waste disposal zone or a dedicated area.
In this case the above ground part should be completely lined with bricks or stones and should be watertight.
At least 1.5m from the bottom of the pit to the groundwater level is recommended.
"Dig a test pit and insert a narrow metal pipe or bar into the soil to a depth of 1.5 m. If the end of the bar is wet or soil removed from the pipe is wet, the pit may be too close to the ground water."
Note that recent heavy rain may affect the results.
"If the groundwater is too close to the bottom of the test pit, consider other options: Changing the design of the pit to make it wider but shallower; Creating more, shallower pits; Creating a pit that is partially in a mound of very well-compacted soil."
"As a rule of thumb, two pits each with capacity for one year should be adequate for any facility."
These chemicals destroy the microorganisms that are important for biological Dispose of organics in the pit as soon as they arrive.
Non-persistent disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide are recommended.
"Ash, charcoal or lime may also be added to reduce odors."
"Lime has a high p. H (about 11) so will kill a lot of pathogens, but beware that it may also kill bacteria needed for rapid and complete decomposition."
"When the level of the waste reaches 0.5 m from the surface, the pit should be closed Mark it permanently to explain the contents and the closure date."
It should be possible to reuse the pit after enough time has elapsed.
"If it is necessary to remove material from an old pit: Leave at least 2 years after the closure of the pit to maximise the elimination of pathogens and their eggs or cysts; If possible, test the material to be sure it is not infectious; Provide workers with PPE (mask, goggles, boots, gloves, overalls); Limit the use of any extracted material as a fertilizer; do not use for food growing (Source: Mdecins Sans Frontires)"
Detailed design of the placenta pit is included in Annex 1.
"Incineration is a high-temperature, dry oxidation process that reduces organic and combustible waste to inorganic, incombustible matter and results in a significant reduction of waste volume and weight."
A disadvantage of these technologies is the release of combustion by-products into the atmosphere and the generation of residual ash.
"Gases are ventilated through the incinerator stacks, and the residue or ash is disposed of in a sanitary landfill."
"If incinerators are properly designed, maintained, and operated, they are effective in killing organisms present in infectious waste."
Identify lead candidate incinerator designs and determine which units Guidelines for Incineration The following guidelines should be included in Incineration: Incineration should be used for aesthetic disposal of pathological wastes such as Incineration should be used to render contaminated sharps unusable.
"The principal factors affecting incineration like variations in waste composition, the waste feed rate, and the combustion temperature should be considered to maintain efficiency of incinerating infectious wastes."
"Proper operating procedures must be Infectious wastes containing drugs should be disposed of in an incinerator that provides high temperatures and enough time for the complete destruction of these The incinerators effectiveness in disposing/destroying chemical wastes should be documented/ assessed before use, if applicable."
Persons involved in Incineration must wear protective clothing and should be trained in handling techniques to minimize personal exposure to hazards from infectious wastes.
"Helmet, safety goggles, respiratory mask, heavyduty heat resistant gloves, apron, clothes that cover the body, heavy-duty heat Prevention of waste spillage during incinerators loading; A clearly described method of operation to achieve the desired combustion conditions and emissions; for example, appropriate start-up and cool-down procedures, achievement and maintenance of a minimum temperature before waste is burned, use of appropriate loading/charging rates (both fuel and waste) to maintain appropriate temperatures, proper disposal of ash and equipment to safeguard workers; Prohibited materials."
They should be located away from houses and crops.
All incinerators should be inspected and maintained by a qualified person on a regular basis.
Unscheduled maintenance is also required in the event of failures.
"A service schedule should be established, and well-trained and qualified"
"During site visits, task performed and consumables or spare parts used should be recorded."
Consumables should also be stocked as part of a routine service Operator logs - It is very important that operator logs are maintained and kept up to date.
"Information recorded in operator logs should include waste deposited and source, waste destroyed, fuel consumed, equipment defects, and service and Enhanced training and management, possibly promoted by certification and inspection programmes for operators, the availability of an operating and maintenance manual, visible management oversight, and regular maintenance schedules; Construction using detailed engineering plans and materials to minimize flaws that may lead to incomplete destruction of waste and premature failures of the incinerator."
"Guidelines on Installation Installation of incinerators should include site preparation, equipment installation and commissioning, service and operating instructions provided by the manufacturer, assured manufacturer support, metal works (fuel tank, filter and supply lines, electrical power supply, etc."
"Incinerators should never be installed in areas where crops are grown; particles from the smoke emitted by the incinerators can settle on crops, making them highly toxic."
"If for whatever reason incinerators have been installed near cultivated land, the incinerator should be operated only when the wind is blowing away from the crops."
The selection of an appropriate location to install an incinerator is of paramount importance.
"Key factors to be taken into consideration are: The location should be at least 30 meters away from the closest occupied or inhabited The prevailing winds at the location should blow in a direction away from occupied There should be no regular public passage within immediate proximity of the The Incinerator Guidebook - A practical guide for selecting, purchasing, installing, operating, and maintaining small-scale incinerators in low-resource settings, Version 1,"
There should be no horticulture or leaf crops within 300 meters of the incinerator in the direction of the prevailing winds.
The location should be secure and free from risk of vandalism or theft.
The location should permit construction of a facility to house the incinerator (unless designed for external use) and store the waste awaiting disposal.
The site should also include an ash pit and placenta pit (as appropriate).
Incineration by itself is not a solution for medical waste disposal.
Protective enclosure Incinerators should be installed in a protective enclosure or suitably ventilated building to prevent access by unauthorized persons and to protect the incineration equipment.
A protective enclosure or building should ensure that: The incinerator and other materials stored inside are protected from rain and UV radiation from direct sunlight.
The incinerator is well ventilated and the stack emissions are clear of the building or enclosure so that the operator is not exposed to fumes when the incinerator is in use.
"The enclosure is robust and corrosion resistant, and its design-life is at least equivalent to the expected life of the incinerator."
The enclosure or building can be securely locked against unauthorized entry.
"There is space within the enclosure to store the operators protective clothing, tools, and equipment required to operate the system."
"There should also be sufficient space to conveniently store waste to be destroyed, as well as load and operate the incinerator."
There is provision for an emergency exit should there be a fire or other emergency at There is storage space for solid fuels or a storage reservoir for fuel.
This is best located within the incinerator enclosure to ensure adequate security.
"The enclosure has a provision for waste to be deposited without allowing the waste handler, to enter the enclosure or building."
All HCWM sites using incineration should be equipped with an ash pit that has sufficient capacity to store ash for a period of at least 5 years.
Essential features of a pit are: The pit is positioned above any shallow aquifer.
The pit is positioned to prevent risk of flooding.
"The pit is constructed of concrete, concrete blocks, or brick, with a water-resistant floor to ensure the pit will not collapse."
"The pit has provision to deposit ash or other authorized wastes (i.e., needle containers), without a risk to the waste handler."
There is provisional access to the pit for purposes of leveling or removal of accumulated waste and subsequent transfer to a municipal landfill.
The pit is protected from access by unauthorized persons.
The pit is in the immediate proximity of the incinerator to ensure convenient transfer of All incinerators require fuel either to preheat (in the case of auto-combustion incinerators) or to assist throughout the incineration process (in the case of fuel-assisted incinerators).
Safe and secure storage of incinerator fuel is imperative.
"There should be adequate space to safely store dry solid fuel (wood, coconut husks, charcoal, etc.)"
"A storage reservoir, fuel filter, and shutoff tap or valve should be positioned within the enclosure or building to ensure the fuel supply is not exposed to excessive heat from the incinerator."
It should be mounted at an appropriate level to ensure
Any storage reservoir should be large enough to store fuel for 3 times the period between normal waste deliveries.
All HCWM disposal facilities should be equipped with a water supply (spigot) mounted above a concrete pad with either a gutter for runoff and percolation into the ground or connection to a drainage channel.
"As a general rule, glass should not be incinerated."
Provision of space within the enclosure or building for equipment to crush glass syringes and vials is important.
"As previously noted, training is critical to proper operation."
"The following are key steps that incinerator Wear personal protective equipment - helmet, goggles, respirator, overcoat/overalls, heavy-duty gloves, apron, and boots."
Ensure fuel is available for operating the incinerator and that the waste to be Record the number of safety boxes and bags to be burned.
"If you see smoke the temperature is too low If the temperature gets too high, add a bag of waste."
If you see fire in the chimney the temperature is too high.
"Very wet loads should be separated with drier material, and in extreme cases supplemented by an extra increment of diesel/kerosene."
"If the incinerator is being loaded with entirely plastic materials, such as syringes in sharps boxes, it is advisable to let one box burn almost completely before adding the next."
The time can be gauged by noting when the smoke level decreases.
This can be done using a length of steel pushed in through the air holes at the front.
"When the loading door is opened, combustible gases may come into contact with air and burn suddenly and fiercely."
This is harmless providing the operator is wearing a face mask/eye protection and is not peering directly into the chamber.
When the loading door is closed suddenly more burning gases may come through the air holes; thus the operator should load from the side.
Wait 10 minutes and add firewood to maintain the fire and ensure the waste is completely burned.
This may take up to 30 minutes.
"When the waste is completely burned, allow the fire to die out."
Do not leave the incinerator until the fire has burned down to embers.
Detailed designs of the incinerators are included in Annex 1.
Guidelines for Facility Waste Management Planning Each HCW generating facility should have a comprehensive waste Management plan as part of an overall health care strategic plan.
The waste management plan should be derived from the national plan.
"The following guidelines should be included in each facilitys plan: Implementation of HCWM plan shall be coordinated by the infection control team/ officer, in collaboration with other stakeholders who are involved in implementation and supervision of Health Care Waste Management practices."
At each facility there should be a designated individual for Health Care Waste Management and this officer should be incorporated into existing Infection Control Committee where applicable.
"In absence of such committees, a waste management committee responsible for the HCWM plan implementation should be established."
Contain monitoring procedure to track day-to-day activities of the HCF and ensure that HCWM rules are adhered to.
Healthcare Wastewater Management Characteristics of Health-care Wastewater Health-care wastewater is any water that has been adversely affected in quality during the provision of healthcare services.
"It is mainly liquid waste, containing some solids produced by humans (staff and patients) or during health-care-related processes, including cooking, cleaning and laundry.21 Health-care wastewater can be divided into the following three categories: Blackwater (sewage) is heavily polluted wastewater that contains high concentrations of Greywater (sullage) contains more dilute residues from washing, bathing, laboratory processes, laundry and technical processes such as cooling water or the rinsing of Stormwater is technically not a wastewater itself, but represents the rainfall collected watercourses and as groundwater recharge, or used for irrigating toilet flushing and other general washing purposes."
Engineering and maintenance Hazards of Wastewater from Health-care Facilities A large part of the wastewater from health-care facilities is of a similar quality to domestic wastewater and poses the same risks.
"Just as domestic wastewater is considered to be potentially infectious, wastewater from health-care facilities must also be considered in a similar manner A proportion of the generated wastewater from health-care facilities will pose a higher risk than domestic wastewater."
"Sewers of health-care facilities are often not watertight, and a significant part of the wastewater in many places may leak into the groundwater."
"Often, working sewage-treatment plants, and sometimes municipal sewerage networks may not even Improper management, collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and sludge will result in the pollution of local drinking water sources, or the contamination of natural resources."
"Health and environmental implications of improper management of healthcare wastewater Excessive nutrients that cause biological degradation in groundwater, lakes and rivers by using up oxygen (eutrophication) resulting in algal blooms and biotoxins; Pharmaceuticals in water may act as endocrine disruptors; Antibiotics could result in antibiotic-resistant pathogens; Mercury and heavy metal poisoning; Water-borne disease outbreaks in communities like Campylobacterosis, cholera, Hepatitis A and E, schistosomiasis, and typhoid fever; Numerous vector-borne diseases (e.g."
"Additionally, higher concentrations of disinfectants can be found."
"Often, the wastewater is hot, has a high p. H (alkaline) and may contain high rates of phosphate and AOX if chlorinebased disinfectants are used."
"Additionally, the organic content can be high due to the disposal of body fluids and rinsing liquids (such as those from suction containers)."
Laboratories are a possible source for chemicals in the wastewater stream.
"Of special relevance are halogenated and organic solvents, colorants from histology and haematology (Gram staining), cyanides (haematology) and formaldehyde and xylene (pathology)."
Laboratories may also contribute to the presence of blood in wastewater from the emptying of samples into solutions in wastewater and potentially contaminated rinsing water.
"In some countries, this source of wastewater contamination is declining due to the increasing use of digital X-ray Haemodialysis requires the disinfection of the dialysers and sometimes the used filters."
"Accordingly, the concentration of disinfectant in the wastewater can be high."
"Collection of Liquid healthcare Waste Segregation, minimization and safe storage of hazardous materials are just as important for liquid wastes as they are for solid wastes."
The two traditional collection arrangements are: Central system of sewage pipes bringing wastewater from throughout the facility to a central underground location for treatment or disposal; and De-centralized system wherein pipes from some medical areas pass wastewater to septic tanks or cesspits.
"A centralized collection and treatment system is the preferred and recommended approach for management of wastewater for health-care facilities especially in regional referral The recommended set-up for management of wastewater from healthcare facilities includes: Construction of two separate collection systems Sewerage system for wastewater (sanitary sewers) Stormwater system for rainwater (stormwater sewers), which can be used for gardens, toilet flushing or washing of paved areas Manholes to allow access for maintenance every 50 meters or less Watertight sewerage pipes and manholes Pre-treatment to reduce or eliminate contaminants in non-domestic wastewater, or in altering its nature before discharging it into the sewer."
Pre-treatment of Liquid healthcare Waste The basic underlying principle of effective wastewater management is a strict limit on the discharge of hazardous liquids to sewers.
"Chemical and pharmaceutical wastes such as photographic chemicals, aldehydes, colorants and antibiotics should not be discharged directly into the sewer drains."
The following pretreatment methods are recommended for the different types of hazardous liquids from healthcare facilities.
Note: 5% hypochlorite is not effective for high organic loads like blood
The trap and collected grease should be removed every 24weeks.
"Note: Non-hazardous chemicals such as syrups, vitamins, or eye drops, small quantities of blood and rinsing liquids from surgical theaters can be discharged in the sewer system without pre-treatment."
"The preferred method is to connect the healthcare sewage system to the municipal sewage system and to discharge healthcare wastewater after adequate pretreatment to municipal sewage if the municipal sewage treatment plant meets the following minimum requirements: Use of primary, secondary and tertiary treatment; Removal of >95% of bacteria; Treatment of sewage sludge to destroy helminth eggs to < 1 egg per liter; Compliance with local regulatory requirements."
"If no municipal sewage system exists, or If the municipal sewage system does not meet basic requirements, or If the area experiences epidemics of enteric diseases or endemic intestinal helminthiasis, the recommended option is on-site wastewater treatment."
"Onsite Wastewater Treatment Large health-care facilities, particularly those that are not connected to any municipal treatment plant, should operate their own wastewater-treatment works."
"Typically, wastewater treatment involves three stages, namely: (See The purpose of this first stage is to prevent the damage or clogging of wastewater treatment equipment and to produce a generally homogeneous liquid capable of being treated subsequently"
"A raked screen is used to remove large objects, after which the velocity of incoming wastewater is reduced to allow the settlement of sand, grit and stones."
"Floating material, such as grease and plastics, is skimmed off, and primary sedimentation tanks are installed to allow faecal solids to settle; The task of secondary treatment is to remove dissolved carbon and nitrogen components by microbial digestion."
"Tertiary treatment, also called effluent polishing, is the final step in a wastewater-treatment process before the effluent is discharged to the receiving environment."
"Tertiary treatment is to further treat the wastewater for the purpose of reducing pathogens, suspended solids, excessive phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients, and/or chemical contaminants."
"Sand filtration, lagooning or planted horizontal gravel filters can be used to remove suspended organic matter."
"Constructed wetlands and engineered reed bed systems are another effective Disinfection of wastewater from health-care establishments is often required, particularly if the wastewater is discharged into any water body used for recreational activities or used as a source 8.17.8.1."
"Disposal of sludge of helminths and other pathogens, and should be treated before disposal."
The most common treatment options include: Anaerobic digestion  This is a complex bacterial process that is carried out in the absence of oxygen and is mainly used for large-scale plants.
"Aerobic digestion Composting - Where the sludge is mixed with a carbon source such as sawdust, straw or wood chips."
Reed beds  Here sludge is applied on a horizontal system  flow reed bed.
"One part of the water is absorbed by the reeds, which then transpire moisture into the air; the other part is returned to the wastewater treatment plant through a drainage layer in the bottom of the reed bed."
"Illustration of On-site Wastewater Treatment for a Referral Decentralized Septic Tank System The minimum treatment method for wastewater is the septic tank, a watertight receptacle for the separation of solid and liquid components of wastewater and for the digestion of organic matter in an anaerobic environment."
"A septic tank normally consists of two or more chambers and can be divided into the following Horizontal: inflow, settlement and clarifying zone Vertical: scum, detention and sludge zone."
The capacity of the septic tank should be equivalent to a total of two days wastewater flow.
"If a two-chamber system is used, the first chamber should be two thirds of the total capacity."
"Access holes, inspection ports and ventilation should be installed in every chamber."
"The effective settling and floating of solids is directly dependent upon the retention time within the tank, which should be not less than 24 hours."
"Solid matter (sludge, scum) from septic tanks must be removed when the chambers are half filled with sludge."
"If the level of solid matter cannot be controlled, it should ideally be removed once every two years."
"Centralized, Basic System Centralized onsite treatment is recommended for health-care facilities to minimize maintenance, allow more advanced treatment, and improve the monitoring of the wastewater system."
The effluents can be further treated.
"If this is not possible, a controlled discharge to soakaway pits or leach fields should be carried out."
"Soakaway pits and leachfields A soakaway pit should have one or more tanks, with the total volume equal to the wastewatertreatment plant."
Effluents from the treatment plant are collected and allowed to infiltrate into the ground.
"The pit may be filled with stones, broken bricks or similar material or may be lined with open-jointed masonry."
"The top 0.5m of the pit should be lined solidly, to provide firm support for a reinforced concrete cover and sealed with cement mortar to prevent the infiltration of rainwater."
Planting trees adjacent to or over a soakaway can improve liquid removal through transpiration and increased soil permeability.
The size of the soak pit depends on the volume of liquid to be disposed of and the type of soil in which the pit is excavated.
Soak pits are commonly between 2 and 5m deep and 1 to 2.5m in When larger amounts of wastewater need to be infiltrated (e.g.
The leach trenches are usually 0.30.5m wide and 0.61.0m deep (from the top of the pipes).
"The trenches are laid with a 0.20.3% gradient of gravel (2050mm diameter), covered by a 0.30.5m layer of soil."
"Both should be kept as far as practicable from shallow water wells and, where possible, they should be installed downstream of water abstraction sources."
"Lagooning system In a region or an individual health-care facility that cannot afford sophisticated sewage-treatment plants, and where infiltration of the wastewater is not possible, a Lagooning system is a basic solution for treating wastewater, if enough land is available ( divided in facultative lagoons (oxygen is supplied primarily by algae) and aerated lagoons (oxygen is supplied by mechanical surface aeration)."
"Mechanical aeration requires comparatively high operational costs (electricity); therefore, facultative lagoons are preferred."
"In the water column, the biodegradable organic materials held in suspension are degraded aerobically."
The oxygen required for aerobic decomposition is supplied by bacteria.
"Facultative lagoons can have the disadvantages of potentially generating pungent odours, variable effluent quality and a need for a large land surface area."
Reed bed systems perform a similar function to lagoons and are regarded as a preferable option if resources exist to establish them.
Operation and Monitoring of Sewerage Systems Problems in the management of wastewater in health-care facilities are mainly due to insufficient operation and maintenance.
In most sink is still practiced daily.
Leakages and blockages are likely to increase where sewers are insufficiently maintained.
"Commonly, the first indication of a problem is large wastewater losses between the entry points (sinks, toilets, drains) and an onsite treatment plant or tank or discharge point into a municipal sewerage system."
"Operation and maintenance of wastewater systems Typical problems in the operation of wastewater systems include: Lack of awareness among senior staff at health-care facilities on wastewater problems; Insufficient or non-functioning pre-treatment and primary treatment systems, or no hazardous wastewater management system; Little or no programme of preventive maintenance; Non-availability of basic tools to carry out maintenance; Use of systems that are too complex to be operated by unskilled workers, or operational costs that are unbudgeted or too high to be affordable."
"To ensure that wastewater-management responsibilities are taken seriously, a trained wastewater officer should be appointed."
"The starting point for developing a successful wastewater system is a wastewater audit, which would identify the expected wastewater streams from each medical and service area of the health-care facility, and provide data for pre-treatment, collection and treatment arrangements for wastewater to be developed."
A maintenance plan to cover both corrective and preventive maintenance should also be prepared.
An often-underestimated aspect in wastewater management is the loss of wastewater during collection and transport.
"Losses of 1030% of the wastewater due to broken sewer pipes, nonwatertight access holes and leakages at pipe connections are common."
Installing a flow meter at the discharge point of the health-care facility is recommended for accurate monitoring.
Maintenance and leakage problems can often be identified through regular (daily or weekly) comparison of water consumption and discharged wastewater quantities.
The most common parameters for monitoring the effluent quality are: BOD5 (a test to estimate the amount of oxygen consumed by biochemical oxidation of waste contaminants in a five-day period at 20C);
"If an onsite treatment plant is operated, the inflow of wastewater and the out flowing treated effluent should be tested regularly to monitor how efficiently the treatment plant reduces the concentration of contaminants."
This is because there is an important link between cleaning of health care facilities and persistence of nosocomial pathogens.
"The purpose of cleaning the environment is to remove visible dirt, reduce the level of microorganisms and to minimize the dissemination of infectious agents in the facility, thereby providing an aesthetically pleasing, sanitary and relatively contamination free environment for patients, staff and visitors."
"These are dispersed during dry dusting, weeping or shaking patient bedding."
"Thorough cleaning will remove 90% of microorganisms; therefore, it has to be done in standardized manner to avoid spreading of contamination."
Environmental Cleaning Program An environmental cleaning program is a structured set of elements or interventions which facilitate implementation of environmental cleaning at a healthcare facility.
The scope of the environmental cleaning program and its implementation can vary (e.g.
"Infrastructure and supplies Monitoring, feedback and audit Externally Contracted Cleaning Service Providers Environmental cleaning programs are increasingly implemented by external companies through a contract or service level agreement."
"Contracted staff, including cleaning staff and cleaning supervisors, should work closely with the cleaning program focal person and IPC staff at the facility to ensure that cleaning is performed according to best practices and facility policy."
"It is essential that all the standard program elements be described explicitly in the service level agreement with the external company, to ensure accountability."
"In general, the components of the service level agreement should be similar to the facility cleaning policy, and at a minimum An organizational chart for all contracted employees, including functional reporting lines and responsibilities; The staffing plan for each patient care area, including contingency plans for additional staff; The training content and frequency for contracted employees; Summary of the cleaning schedules and methods for each patient care area, in line with the facility policy; The methods for routine monitoring and feedback; The supplies and equipment to be used."
Organization / Administration Facility-level organizational support is a key program element in the implementation of an effective environmental cleaning program.
"Ensuring that structured training activities are carried out for all new staff and on a Ensuring that routine monitoring is implemented and results are used for program Ensuring that cleaning supplies and equipment are available in required quantities and in good condition (i.e., preventing stock-outs)."
The primary communication structures to establish include: Multi-sectorial planning committee  Engages all facility stakeholders during the development of SOPs and service level agreements (if contracted services are used).
These meetings should be conducted at least monthly.
The required elements include: Cleaning program organizational chart Appropriate number of staff and training are key program elements.
"Cleaning staff should be paid positions that have: Written job descriptions or terms of reference; Structured, targeted training (e.g., pre-service, annual, when new equipment is Defined performance standards or competencies; Access to an on-site supervisor to ensure they can safely perform their work (e.g., address supply shortage, safety concerns)."
"The Environmental cleaning staff should: Be familiar with their job descriptions and performance standards; Perform duties only for which they were trained (e.g., cleaning staff should not be asked to clean high-risk wards (e.g., operating room), unless they have received specific training for that patient care area); Know the identities and hazards of the chemicals that they could be exposed to in the"
Adequate staffing is one of the most important factors for an effective environmental cleaning program.
"In small primary health care facilities with limited inpatient services, cleaning staff might be part-time positions or have other responsibilities, such as laundry services, but most The required number of cleaning staff will vary based on several of factors, including: Type of cleaning (e.g."
"It should be mandatory, structured, targeted, and delivered in the right style (e.g., participatory) and conducted before staff can work independently within the healthcare facility."
"If cleaning services are contracted out, the training requirements and content should be specified in the service level agreement."
Supporting Infrastructure and Supply Elements The facility infrastructure is critical for an effective environmental cleaning program.
"These areas must be available within the facility itself, regardless of whether the program is managed in-house or by external company; Access to adequate water and wastewater services/systems - Environmental cleaning requires large quantities of water and produces almost as much wastewater, which must be disposed of safely and appropriately to prevent contamination of the environment and surrounding community; Systems to procure and manage environmental cleaning supplies and equipment; Appropriate selection of finishes, furnishings and patient care equipment that can be effectively cleaned and are compatible with the facility disinfectant(s)."
"Policies and Procedural Elements Healthcare facilities should develop cleaning policies, SOPs, checklists and job aids for implementation of an effective environmental cleaning program."
"The facility environmental cleaning policy provides the standard to which the facility will perform to meet the best practices and enables a common understanding among the staff of the required program and should always include the following elements: Defined lines of accountability and functional reporting lines and responsibilities for all Cleaning schedules for every patient care area and noncritical patient care equipment, specifying the frequency, method, and staff responsible; Contingency plans and required cleaning procedures for environmentally hardy organisms and for outbreak management; Training requirements and performance standards for cleaning staff; Monitoring methods, frequency, and staff responsible; List of approved cleaning products, supplies, and equipment and any required specifications on their use; vii)	 List of necessary PPE and when hand hygiene action is recommended for staff and"
Standard Operating Procedures Facility-specific SOPs for each environmental cleaning task are essential to guide cleaning staff practices.
"The SOPs should be developed and made readily available to cleaning staff, cleaning supervisors and other ward staff as needed for reference."
"General Environmental Cleaning Techniques The following general strategies will apply for all environmental cleaning procedures: Conduct visual preliminary site assessment to determine if there is need for additional PPE or supplies, there are any obstacles or issues that could pose a challenge to safe cleaning or if there is any damaged or broken furniture or surfaces to be reported to Proceed from cleaner to dirtier areas to avoid spreading dirt and microorganisms."
General Surface Cleaning Process The general surface cleaning process is outlined below: Thoroughly wet (soak) a fresh cleaning cloth in the environmental cleaning solution; Fold the cleaning cloth in half until it is about the size of your hand.
"This will ensure that you can use all of the surface area efficiently (generally, fold them in half, then in half again, and this will create eight sides); III)	 Wipe surfaces using the general strategies as above (e.g., clean to dirty, high to low, systematic manner), making sure to use mechanical action (for cleaning steps) and making sure that the surface is thoroughly wetted to allow required contact time (for IV)	  Regularly rotate and unfold the cleaning cloth to use all of the sides; When all of the sides of the cloth have been used or when it is no longer saturated with solution, dispose of the cleaning cloth or store it for reprocessing; VI)	 Repeat process from step I)."
Recommended methods of cleaning for the routinely used items are presented in Recommended methods of cleaning for routinely used items Recommended Method of Cleaning Dump dusting with water detergent Leave surfaces clean and dry Materials needed should be designated for Beds should not be wooden.
Replace with unopened Change curtains frequently Isolation room curtains should be changed with each terminal cleaning All areas cleaned with water and detergent All drainages covered with wire mesh to observe high level hygiene.
Food surfaces should be wiped with0.1% Rinse thoroughly and leave to dry on rack diseases at recruitment and All leftover food should be disposed off immediately to All health care workers to put on uniforms in health care facilities Reusable protective like plastic aprons and boots should be properly cleaned by the user at the end of the procedure or day They should be wiped with Jik if blood spillages or spots have occurred.
Protective clothes should be Use high level containment safety cabinets when handling infectious agents (e.g.
"Brucellosis, TB and Plague) Protect health workers from Wash with water and detergent daily If there is any blood or body fluids decontaminate with 0.5% hypochlorite, The health facility should be fenced off Grass should be cut short Paving and growing of glass to avoid bare Wipe with warm water and detergent blood and other body fluids Wipe with warm water and detergent blood and other body fluids Wipe with warm water and detergent."
Hygiene in Specialised Areas The following are some of the areas in the healthcare settings that require special attention to Intensive Care units (ICU) General Considerations for Specialized Areas Specialized areas should be treated as follows: Cleaning equipment should be designated to particular areas.
"For example, in the operating theatre the cleaning equipment for the inner zone should be different from Floors should be cleaned after every procedure and at the end of the day; The walls should be cleaned from heights of 2.53 meters downwards; IV."
Proceed from high to low (top to bottom) to prevent dirt and microorganisms from dripping or falling and contaminating already cleaned areas; Cleaning should be done with water and detergent; VI.
"Change cleaning cloths when they are no longer saturated with solution, for a new, wetted cloth."
Soiled cloths should be stored for reprocessing.
Designate cleaning materials to each patient area in intensive care unit Air entering these units should be filtered where possible
Effective supervision of the cleaners is necessary Flowers can be a source of infection and should not be allowed tin special Environmental sampling should only be done if a possible source of Linen and Laundry Management used on mattresses.
"There are three categories of Healthcare Linen which include: Foul linen: Linen requiring sluicing before laundering such as babies nappies Soiled linen: Normal used linen Infected linen: Linen that may require sluicing and disinfection before final laundering Linen (and laundry) handling The following are some of the best practices for linen (and laundry) handling: Always wear reusable rubber gloves before handling soiled linen (e.g., bed sheets, Never carry soiled linen against the body."
"If there is any solid excrement on the linen, such as faeces or vomit, scrape it off carefully with a flat, firm object and put it in the commode or designated toilet/latrine before putting linen in the designated container."
Do not transport soiled linen by hand outside the specific patient care area from where it was removed.
"Reprocess (i.e., clean and disinfect) the designated container for soiled linen after each vii)	 If reusable linen bags are used inside the designated container, do not overfill them, tie them securely, and launder after each use."
Soiled linen bags can be laundered with the soiled linen they contained.
"Effectiveness of the laundering process depends on many factors, including: Water quality (p. H, hardness) Model/availability of commercial washers and dryers Always use and maintain laundry equipment according to manufacturers Always launder soiled linens from patient care areas in a designated area, which should: Be a dedicated space for performing laundering of soiled linen; Not contain any food, beverage or personal items; Have floors and walls made of durable materials that can withstand the exposures of the area (e.g., large quantities of water and steam); Have a separation between the soiled linen and clean linen storage areas, and ideally should be at negative pressure relative to other areas; Have hand washing facilities; Have SOPs and other job aids to assist laundry staff with procedures."
"Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Laundry Staff The best practices for personal protective equipment (PPE) for laundry staff include: Practice hand hygiene before application and after removal of PPE; Wear tear-resistant reusable rubber gloves when handling and laundering soiled linens; If there is risk of splashing, for example, if laundry is washed by hand, laundry staff should always wear gowns or aprons and face protection (e.g."
"Disinfectants are generally not needed when soiling is at low levels; Use disinfectant on a case by case basis, depending on the origin of the soiled linen (e.g."
"If laundry services with hot water are not available, reprocess soiled linens manually according Immerse in detergent solution and use mechanical action (e.g."
"Management of Clean Linen The following best practices for management of clean linen should be followed: Sort, package, transport, and store clean linens in a manner that prevents risk of contamination by dust, debris, soiled linens or other soiled items; Each floor/ward should have a designated room for sorting and storing clean linens; Transport clean linens to patient care areas on designated carts or within designated containers that are regularly (e.g."
"Vector/vermin control in HCFs is critical to preventing the spread of diseases between patients, and staff."
"For effective management of vectors and vermin that are harmful and impact adversely on the health care facilities, health care activities and spread of diseases and infections."
Vectors and Vermin Regular visual inspection of health care facilities in search of signs of presence of vectors and vermin should be incorporated into the routine maintenance protocols.
"The following types of vectors and vermin are most common at the health care facilities and their presence can be detected by citing damage caused, alive or dead individuals, droppings and smells: Mammals: Bats are among the most commonly cited vermin in the health care facilities."
"Apart from posing risk of zoonotic diseases, they pollute the air by causing a foul smell Rodents: Rats are the commonly cited rodents in the health care facilities."
"Problems caused by rats include; damage to equipment and personal properties as they prepare for nesting, nibbling on food stuffs resulting into waste as the food is disposed of, and introducing vectors like fleas."
Reptiles: These may include snakes.
"Although many snake species are not poisonous, seeing one particularly indoors may cause nervousness, stress or stampede."
Insects are the most successful class of the animal kingdom and are thus difficult to control.
Birds: Birds that nest inside houses are not aggressive to humans but cause foul smells from the debris they collect in their nests.
The debris and birds themselves could harbor mites which can cause allergic reactions in some people.
"The following methods of controlling vectors and vermin may be employed: Architectural and Engineering Designs Considerations Ventilators of ceilings and similar openings should be fitted with netting material to block access of rats, bats and birds into the ceiling from the outside environment; Avoid dead spaces and crevices between walls and furniture (cabinets, wardrobes, etc.)"
They also gather dust because they are difficult to clean and ultimately attract various insects.
"The dust may also cause allergies to people; Use well-fitting window screens to eliminate entry for insects, birds and bats; In areas with heavy infestations of termites, use of metallic installations should be considered over wooden ones."
Fumigation and application of pesticides and insecticides Chemical methods of prevention and control of vectors and vermin are very effective but they are not environmentally friendly.
Fumigation employs use of highly poisonous gases which may leak into the surrounding environment beyond the health care facility.
"Therefore, skilled personnel should be hired to conduct the fumigation exercises."
Fumigation may be done once or twice a year depending on the levels of infestation and type of vectors involved.
Advice of a skilled fumigator should be sought on the frequency of fumigation.
It should be noted that over fumigation may lead to chemical resistance developing in the vector population.
"In as far as possible, poisons specific to a particular species should be used; Use of repellants."
Napthalene is effective for many vectors but use of repellants in general is discouraged because people who spend long periods in rooms where the repellants are applied get exposed by inhaling the chemical fumes.
Use of repellants should be limited to rooms that are not permanently occupied;
Insecticides/pesticides can be used to treat small local infestations and to prevent build-up of populations.
Pyrethrins are recommended because they are not very toxic to people and do not persist in the environment; Desiccant dusts are put in cabinets where insects are known to occur.
Strategically placed traps can be used to capture or monitor presence of adult vectors and vermin.
"Landscaping and Gardening Outdoor environments that are attractive and appealing address the emotional and psychological needs of patients, care takers and staff."
"There is growing scientific evidence that viewing gardens can reduce stress in patients and treats the anxiety that may accompany illness, thus generally improving the health outcomes."
"While designs of HCFs tend to focus on reducing risks of infections, emphasis should also be put on creating environments that have pleasant and stress reducing characteristics."
"Landscape and gardening features With regard to the general topography of the area, landscape designs may require modifying the contours before construction of structures and creation of gardens."
The general principle that should be put into consideration while preparing landscape designs is site safety.
The outdoor environment should not in any way endanger the lives of people.
Site safety may be linked to several other principles detailed below.
Appropriate plants should be chosen for the different areas that are included in the landscape design following these as general principles; Avoid growing poisonous plants even when they add beauty to the landscape.
Consultations should be made with botanists for advice.
"For example, some ornamental plants belonging to the Araceae family, like Syngonium sp ( Many invasive plant species are ornamental yet they pose harmful effects to the ecosystems."
These must be avoided and advice of specialists should be sought.
"For these landscapes: A warm and welcoming effect should be created at the entrance using colourful flowers, ornamental shrubs and trees that exhibit various effects of shape and size; The therapeutic effects of plants help to calm down patients and reduce anxiety."
The floor where tents are used should be paved to avoid the dusty bare grounds that form as a result of over trampling.
"Dust can harbour vectors like flees; View of the outdoor environment should be made possible by locating windows such that patients who are unable to move out can also experience the beauty and calm that is created by the beautiful gardens; Trees should not be so much isolated from the buildings because they give a cooling effect onto the houses during the hot seasons, yet they should not be too close or too many as they may cause the interior to feel chilly."
Trees that are too close to buildings can cause damage to the building by the roots cracking the foundation and walls; Crevices that develop on the building along verandas or in the walls should be repaired immediately because the crevices could form hiding places for vectors and vermin.
"The crevices can also accumulate soil, giving a good substrate for plants to grow."
Lawns should be kept meticulously clean and with short grass.
These may accelerate recovery through psychological feeling of body renewal.
Both private and group seating should be availed.
Group seats encourage human interaction but can also be a source of infection.
Patients with infectious diseases should be advised to isolate by taking the Childrens play areas.
Recuperating and visiting children may want to be active.
Play areas should offer a wide assortment of items and activities.
The ground in these areas should be safe; either with sand or a grass species that will withstand trampling.
Concrete surfaces should be avoided here.
Shrubs and Trees These are planted for beauty and creating a relaxing environment by reducing stress and anxiety.
"The following principles should be followed when planting trees/shrubs: The species of trees/shrubs chosen should not be the types favoured by animals that are locally considered as vermin/vectors; Locally used medicinal plants that dont require harvesting by debarking or uprooting may be considered for planting; Ornamental fruit plants may also be planted because they could supplement diets of Ornamental trees/shrubs should be positioned so that they are visible from inside too; Shade trees should be planted and the areas designated as resting places, fitted with 10.6.2.3."
Driveways and Parking Spaces These should be safe and clean.
Specific principles should include:
They should be fitted with clearly visible signs for directions.
"The signposts should be large and easy to see from a reasonable distance, standing at a height of five to six feet (eye level for average height persons), with contrasting background and word colours (e.g."
Choice of colour of signage should not blend with the background vegetation or buildings but instead contrast with it for easy siting.
"Trees that drop heavy parts like large palm leaves, fruits or branches are potentially dangerous and shouldnt be planted along driveways and parking spaces; Regular monitoring of the surfaces should be observed to ensure that they are always levelled."
Potholes should be filled up and protruding parts should be levelled.
"The signpost is not obstructed by surrounding vegetation, and is written in large dark-coloured words on a white background."
Specific principles that would guide designing walkways should include: Surfaces need to be paved.
"The surfaces should be smooth but slip proof, with nothing to cause tripping; there should be regular monitoring for presence of sunken or protruding pavers and these should be attended to as soon as they are discovered."
"When used, ornamental bushes lining the walkways should be far enough to avoid clinging of clothing, wheel chairs, etc."
Hand rails need to be installed where the gradient is high.
Storm Water Drainage Stormwater drainage systems should be designed in accordance with the approved national engineering standards to adequately and safely convey the stormwater flowing on the HCFs premises to avoid flooding and nuisance of deposits carried by the stormwater.
The storm water drainage systems may comprise of the following: Lined open channel drains The lining material may include the following:
The choice of fence type to be used should be guided by the local housing plans of the cities/towns.
Where there is freedom of choice then factors like financing (development and maintenance) should be considered.
"Live fences have the advantage of contributing to cleaning up the environment through air purification and dust control, and the main disadvantage of requiring regular maintenance which may be costly."
"Wall fences, barbed wire and chain links may be expensive to install but require less frequent maintenance and are therefore cheaper to maintain in the long run."
"Various combinations of fence types may be used depending on the special needs of the facility, for example, a live fence enforced with chain link or barbed wire is recommended in areas where domestic animals seek grazing or resting places within the facility premises."
It is critical that all WASH facilities are kept fully operational and clean to reduce transmission of diseases.
"Poorly maintained or unclean facilities will deter people from using them, and can become an epicentre in transmitting various diseases."
There is a need to ensure clear management arrangements and planning for costs and O&Mrequirements before installation For sustainability of effective WASH facilities at health care facilities.
The monthly or annual operating cost must be estimated so the management can budget accordingly.
"Costs may include the water supply, consumables (soap, cleaning products, PPE for cleaners etc), staff costs, monitoring, repairs and eventually replacement of the worn-out facilities."
O&Mplanning and budgeting should be a key aspect under here as it is the starting point for the above listed activities.
These should be practiced regarding the maintenance of WASH facilities.
Check for the internal locks on the Appropriate anal cleansing material Check if squat hole cover is tightly fitted and has a firm handle Ensure the surface water continues to drain away from the toilet facility.
Check for obvious smell or high Check if the handwashing facility and its components are visibly Check is there is any stagnant Check for evidence of cracks on Keep area clean and disinfected Carefully sweep the area around Clean tools and equipment Store healthcare wastes in an Maintain fuel stock levels Reinstall grit after cleaning Ensure the fencing is intact Check vertical fixings of Carry out a early morning test to check if the foot valve holds water in the rising main overnight Check whether the pump delivery is Check if the pump is firmly fixed in Check for loose nuts and bolts on
"Pump Element As the pumping element is water lubricated, it should not require service."
"However, if service or replacements become necessary, the work can be carried out on the site without special tools Packed Glands The gland should be inspected and adjusted regularly to provide the correct lubrication with a slight leakage."
"The gland packing should be replaced approximately every  hours, or sooner if the gland shows signs of excessive leakage."
Grease gland bolts and nuts at each inspection Bearings are rated for operation in excess of  hours.
"However, wear will occur quickly if bearings are allowed to operate without lubrication or under dirty conditions, or if overloaded due to excessive belt tension Open Cage Bearings Check every  hours."
Sealed bearings require no attention Belt Tension Belt tension should be checked during gland inspections.
"If belts need replacement, replace ALL belts with a matched set Column, Driveshaft, Bobbin Bearings Need for replacement of any worn or defective units will be obvious from visual inspection, but as withdrawal of column and driveshaft assemblies, and the pumping elements, requires time and effort it is wise always to replace any items which are suspect The pump stator is natural rubber moulded inside a metal tube, and should not be lubricated with any petroleum-based products (i.e., hand cleaner, grease etc.)."
Approaches to HCF O&MThe HCF O&Mstrategy should largely be based on the preventative approach with limited room for corrective and reactive approaches.
"This approach extends the lifetime of WASH infrastructure, saves costs in the long-term and also reduces the frequency with which expensive reactive maintenance or emergency backup solutions are required (HARVEY 2015)."
"The approach requires that O&Mwork is planned, adequately scheduled and carried out on a regular basis to maintain and keep the WASH infrastructure in good condition."
"The HCF periodically assesses WASH infrastructure replacing or repairing something that was done incorrectly or that needs to be changed: an example is the reallocation of a pipe route or replacement of a faulty pump, inappropriate taps at hand washing facilities in light of the COVID The HCF should develop a clear detailed O&Mcrisis response plan to adequately respond to a WASH crisis or client complaint due to failure and or malfunctioning or breakdown of WASH equipment."
This is best handled by flexibility to request for funds to locally procure spare parts and engage locally available skilled personnel to repair the malfunctioning system.
"HCFs should set up a WASH committee that bear the responsibility to plan, budget, monitor and maintain WASH facilities."
"Depending on the facility committee should consist of an in charge, supervisor(s), and attendant each with assigned responsibilities in relation to maintaining sanitation In order to properly plan for O&Mactivities and inspections, daily, monthly, quarterly and annual work plans should be developed along with a clear procedure for reporting gaps or problems with the WASH infrastructure."
"III)	 Specific WASH O&Mroles and responsibilities for all facility staff cadre such as administration, coordination and management should be determined, agreed upon and communicated to all staff, partners and the HCF WASH committee."
"IV)	 To ensure that WASH services are reliable, spare materials and parts for repair and maintenance should always be should if possible be sourced from local stores and The required number of tools and equipment for the operation and maintenance of the WASH facilities shall be determined by the HCF In-charge."
Recommended supplies for normal usage and operation of WASH facilities shall be in sufficient quantities and standards for effective and efficient operation and maintenance of the WASH The financial requirements for the provision of the above requirements are to be determined by the HCF In-charge together with the HCF staff.
HCF budgets should always include a component for O&Mand should include flexibility to deal with unforeseen challenges.
Monitoring for HCF WASH O&MDetailed monitoring is an important aspect of O&M.
Maintenance Workforce Arrangements Routine and periodic maintenance services are only possible if staff have maintenance plans incorporated in their daily facility routines.
"They should thus: (i) Establish a committee comprising of key staff including health in charge, nurses/ midwives, supervisor(s), and patient attendant(s) with clear roles and responsibilities (ii)	 Have clear sanitation infrastructure maintenance roles and responsibilities (iii)	 Have a description of staff roles on management of sanitation infrastructure and (iv)	 Have new patient and care giver sanitation facility use and maintenance orientation (v)	 Hold daily sanitation facility maintenance orientation sessions for new patients and (vi)	 Develop and regularly review sanitation operation and maintenance plans including include regular or incidental repairs and scheduled maintenance."
HCFs should consider implementing the following activities to bolster WASH O&M: Operation and maintenance plan must be put in place to cover for the running and repairs of sanitation infrastructure and services.
This should include regular or incidental repairs and scheduled maintenance activities.
"Toilets should be cleaned whenever they are dirty, and at least thrice a day with a disinfectant used on all exposed surfaces and a brush to remove visible soiling."
"Strong disinfectants are unnecessary and should not be used in large quantities (reference: Essential environmental health standards in HCF, 2008)."
There should be weekly and daily cleaning schedule that specify when sanitation facilities should be cleaned and supplied with cleaning and hygiene agents.
Cleaning schedule should identify persons or groups responsible for undertaking the cleaning
The schedules should be displayed for easy access and be shared among responsible managers.
"Orientation, training, and education of users is an important aspect of operations that must be implemented."
"Orientation materials, personnel and time should be dedicated to help new comers, regular visitors, and staff members."
"It will be the responsibility of each individual facility to obtain tools for monitoring and evaluation exercise, and to make sure that they are being implemented on time."
Faecal sludge should be emptied when the septic tank is  full.
"Cleaning and maintenance inspection activities should be documented and reported in weekly vii)	 Maintaining cleanliness and ensuring good level of hygiene for HCF compound and viii)	 Promote hygiene to foster a sense of accountability towards maintaining HCF hygienic conditions and thereby strengthening and sustaining HCWs, patients, attendants and visitors motivation to properly maintain and operate WASH facilities."
"When planning for WASH facilities, it is important to note that health may not be the strongest determinant for encouraging people to maintain facilities but rather aspects such as privacy, safety and convenience, as well as observation of culture and religious norms, protection of social status and self-esteem."
"Robust planning can facilitate immediate, incremental investments in WASH leading to continuous availability of WASH services."
WASH for Health care services and operations at the various facilities should be organized and planned.
"Planning for WASH facilities in HCFs involves all organizations listed in respective roles and responsibilities starting with the In-charge officer and the respective Health Where in-house capabilities are insufficient, technical and / or specialized planning requirements / activities for WASH facilities involving capital development or rehabilitation works shall be outsourced and carried out in accordance with the PPDA regulations and guidelines."
The annual budget for WASH requirements for respective HCF is to be prepared by the HCF section in charges.
National level monitoring Monitoring at national level is aimed at measuring the extent to which the set WASH standards in HCFs are adhered to and identify areas for remedial actions.
The tracking will be based on the prevailing District Health Information Software (DHIS 2) or any other software as may be duly approved.
"Specific Monitoring /follow up tasks include: Through DHIS2, store national WASH in HCFs performance data from different DLGs; Provide technical advice and support DLGs on monitoring and follow up process of Review and provide feedback on monitoring reports from DLGs; Undertake WASH in HCFs support supervision visits to DLGs; and Organize national/regional stakeholder WASH in HCFs review meetings."
The primary objective of monitoring WASH services in HCFs is to measure the extent to which these guidelines are implemented and identify areas for immediate improvement.
"They are aligned with the WHO Guidelines on core components of IPC programmes at the national and acute health care facility level , the Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Framework at the Facility Level (IPCAF)."
"These indicators do not fully capture the ideal service levels, but represent an approximation of the normative ideal which can be readily At least 50% of all health care facilities in each District have basic WASH services by 2022, and 80% by 2025, with the ultimate aim of 100% by 2030; By 2030, higher levels of WASH services are achieved universally in 80% of Districts where universal basic WASH services have been achieved already."
"In addition, the chapter provides examples of tools that can be used for collecting data during monitoring activities at different level of the health care facilities."
The provided indicators herein for routine national monitoring have integrated JMP indicators.
Further integration can be incorporated in to existing reporting systems such as: Health Information Monitoring Systems (HMIS) Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (Em.
"ONC) District Health Information Systems 2 (DHS2) IPC Assessment Framework - pairs with national monitoring The provided indicators also include those that can be used to measure WASH in HCF service consistency, safety, functionality and sustainability."
Several indicators have been developed to guide the monitors on what they should look for during the process.
"Indicators have been developed around the key aspects of WASH namely, water availability and accessibility, adequate accessibility of sanitation and hygiene facilities as well as vector/vermin control systems in HCFs 13.5.	 Who and When to Monitor The sector leads are responsible for monitoring and following up on implementation and progress as well as status of WASH services in all HCFs in the country."
"However, to improve facility ownership of the WASH monitoring process and results, a bottom-up participatory approach will be adopted commencing at community HCFs to District, regional and eventually national level."
"WASH in Health Care Facility Indicators Definition: Proportion of health care facilities where the main source of water is an improved source, located on the health care premises, from which water is available."
"Improved water sources are those which, by nature of their design and construction, have the potential to deliver safe water."
"Water from the main water source is available on the day of the survey or Basic Sanitation Services Definition: Proportion of health care facilities with improved and usable sanitation facilities, with at least one toilet dedicated for staff, at least one sex-separated toilet with menstrual hygiene facilities, and at least one toilet accessible for users with limited mobility."
Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.
Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.
For the purpose of this document toilets is taken to mean any of these improved facilities.
"Toilets are available, functional, and private: Available to patients and staff (toilets are on premises; doors are unlocked or a key is available at all times) Functional (the toilet is not broken, the toilet hole is not blocked, there should be no cracks or leaks in the toilet structure and water is available for flush/ Private (there are closable doors that can be locked from the inside and no large gaps or holes in the structure) on the day of the survey or questionnaire."
There are separate toilet facilities dedicated for patient and staff use.
"At least one toilet is separated for use by women/girls, and has a bin with a lid on it and/or water and soap available in a private space for washing."
Toilets are considered accessible if they meet relevant national or local standards.
"In the absence of such standards, toilets should be accessible without stairs or steps, have handrails for support attached either to the floor or sidewalls, a door which is at least 80 cm wide, and the door handle and seat within reach of people using wheelchairs or crutches/sticks.2213.6.3."
"A hand hygiene facility is any device that enables staff and patients to clean their hands effectively, such as a sink with tap, water tank with tap, bucket with tap or other similar device."
"To be considered functional, hand hygiene facilities at points of care must have either alcohol-based hand rub, or soap and water."
"If alcohol-based hand rub is used, health care staff may carry a dispenser around between points of care."
"To be considered functional, hand hygiene facilities at toilets must have soap and water available within 5 m of toilets."
Alcohol-based rub is not considered adequate for hand hygiene at toilet as it does not remove faecal matter from hands.
"Chlorinated water (a prepared solution of chlorine suspended in water) is not considered an adequate substitute for soap and water, or for alcohol-based hand rub."
Points of care are any location in the health care facility where care or treatment is delivered (e.g.
Basic health care waste management services Definition: Proportion of health care facilities where waste is safely segregated in consultation areas and sharps and infectious wastes are treated and disposed of safely.
"At least three clearly labelled or colour coded bins should be in place to separate sharps waste23,  infectious waste24, and  non-infectious general waste."
"Bins should be no more than three quarters (75%) full, and each bin should not contain waste other than that corresponding to its label."
Bins should be appropriate to the type of waste they are to contain; sharps containers should be puncture-proof and others should be leak-proof.
Bins for sharps waste and infectious waste should have lids.
Consultation areas are rooms or areas within the health care facility where care or treatment is delivered.
Wastes may also be collected and transported off-site for medical waste treatment and disposal.
"Basic environmental cleaning practices Definition: Proportion of health care facilities which have protocols for cleaning, and staff with cleaning responsibilities have all received training on cleaning procedures."
"Protocols should include: Step-by-step techniques for specific tasks, such as cleaning a floor, cleaning a sink, cleaning a spillage of blood or body fluids A cleaning roster or schedule specifying the frequency at which cleaning tasks Includes non-health care providers, such as cleaners, whose tasks include cleaning, as well as health care providers who, in addition to their patient care duties, are responsible for cleaning."
Questions for health care facility surveys The following core questions should be considered for use in any survey or WASH at HCF survey or other data collection tool.
Efforts should be made to use these questions or all questions for a particular indicator to ensure that we are able to report on any of the basic service levels for WASH in HCF.
"Questions are presented in a format for enumerator- collected surveys, but in some cases, different options may be necessary for enumerator surveys and for administrative questionnaires."
"In such cases, an alternative question is provided to offer flexibility based on survey type and capacities."
"The core questions are presented in five sections: questions related to  water,  sanitation,  hygiene,  health care waste management and  environmental Effective functioning of a health care facility, and the ability to prevent the spread of infections, relies on a safe, sufficient and reliable supply of water on premises."
"Where water is available from multiple sources, the main source should be recorded."
The recommended categories are based on JMP definitions of improved and unimproved water sources.
What is the main water supply for the facility?
"If there is more than one source, the one used most frequently should be selected."
"If patients need to bring water from home because water is not available at the facility, no water source should be selected."
"Question 1b asks about location of the water supply, in recognition of the fact that health care facilities need large volumes of water (for example 100 Lof water per delivery and 40-60 Lper inpatient per day) and therefore should have a water supply located on premises to be able to meet the demands of the facility."
"Question 1b asks about location of the water supply, in recognition of the fact that health care facilities need large volumes of water (for example 100 Lof water per delivery and 40-60 Lper inpatient per day) and therefore should have a water supply located on premises to be able to meet the demands of the facility."
Where is the main water supply for the facility located?
This question refers to the location from where the water is accessed for use in the health facility (e.g.
"To be considered available, water should be available at the facility at the time of the survey or questionnaire."
"Where possible, the enumerator should confirm that water is available from this source, e.g."
Core Sanitation Questions Question 2a Sanitation in health care facilities should ensure the hygienic separation of excreta from human contact.
"Sanitation is also important for dignity and human rights and has an important gender element, as toilets should ensure privacy and safety for the needs of women"
What type of toilets/latrines are at the facility for patients?
"Flush / Pour-flush  toilet to sewer connection Flush / Pour-flush  toilet to tank or pit Flush / Pour-flush  toilet to open drain Pit latrine without slab/open pit No toilet/latrine (skip to G-H1) Other (specify) ___________ If more than one type of toilet is used, the most common type of toilet/latrine in the service area should be selected."
"Question 2b Sanitation questions aim at establishing the availability of usable, improved toilets for patients and staff in a given service area to provide a general assessment of how well sanitation facilities support hygienic separation of human waste from user contact and uphold patient and staff rights, dignity and comfort."
Certain sanitation technologies are more likely than others to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact.
"These are categorized by the JMP as improved sanitation facilities, while others are labelled as unimproved, following the same definitions and categories used for household-level monitoring."
"To be considered usable, a toilet should be available, functional and private at the time of the survey or questionnaire."
"Toilets are available when on premises, doors are unlocked or with a key available at all times."
"To be functional, the hole or pit is not blocked, water is available for flush/pour flush toilets, and there are no cracks or leaks in the toilet structure."
"To be considered private, the toilet stall has doors that can be locked from the inside and there are no large gaps or holes in the structure."
"If any of these criteria are not met, the toilet/latrine is not counted as usable"
Staff toilets should be for the exclusive use of staff.
Toilets can be in a room with multiple stalls or in a private room with a single toilet.
Toilets in rooms with multiple stalls should all be dedicated for use by either women or men.
"A gender-neutral room with a single toilet is also considered as sex-separated, as it allows women and men to use toilets separately."
"In the absence of such standards, it should meet the following conditions: Can be accessed without stairs or steps, Handrails for support are attached either to the floor or sidewalls, The door is at least 80 cm wide, and The door handle and seat are within reach of people using wheelchairs or crutches/sticks."
"Firstly, solicits information about staff-dedicated toilets (regardless of whether they are sexseparated) which is important in health care facilities to reduce risk of infections, particularly in Understand if toilets are sex- separated such that there is at least one usable toilet available for women and girls."
This toilet(s) must be accessible to patients and does not need to be sex-specific as facilities may have one gender- neutral toilet for users with limited mobility.
The minimum number of toilets required to meet the criteria for a basic sanitation service is one toilet dedicated for staff and one gender-neutral toilet for patients that has menstrual hygiene facilities and is accessible for people with limited mobility.
"Hand hygiene is an important aspect of infection prevention and control in HCF, both at points Question 3a asks about the availability of functional hand hygiene facilities at points of care, which are important to deliver safe care and reduce infections."
"Hand hygiene facilities may consist of either soap and water or alcohol- based hand sanitizer ABHR (which health care workers, patients, visitors and care giver may have)."
"No, there are hand hygiene facilities  at points of care but not functional, or lacking soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub."
"No, no hand hygiene facilities  at points of care No, no hand hygiene facilities at the health care facility (if yes, skip to G-C1) For facilities with multiple consultation rooms or areas, select one at random and observe if a functional hand hygiene facility is present."
"A functional hand hygiene facility is any device that enables staff, patients and visitors to clean their hands effectively."
"It may consist of soap and water with a basin/pan for washing hands, or alcoholbased hand rub (ABHR)."
"If ABHR is used, health care staff may carry a dispenser around between points of care."
Chlorinated water (a prepared solution of chlorine suspended in water) is not considered an adequate substitute for soap and water or for ABHR.
Points of care are any location in the health care facility where care or treatment is delivered (e.g.
The term hand washing is used as ABHR is not an effective solution for hand hygiene at toilets because it does not remove fecal matter.
More information can be found on the requirements for hand hygiene in the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care.253b.
"No, there are hand washing facilities near the toilets but lacking soap and/or water WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care."
"No, no hand washing facilities near toilets (within 5 meters) Hand washing facilities at toilets must include water and soap, rather than ABHR alone, since ABHR does not Check yes if at least one toilet has a hand washing facility with soap and water within 5 meters."
"Core Health Care Waste Management Questions Waste produced from health care activities, from contaminated needles to radioactive isotopes, can cause infection and injury, and inadequate management is likely to have serious public health consequences and deleterious effects on the environment."
"Yes, waste is segregated into three labelled bins No, bins are present but do not meet all requirements or waste is not correctly For facilities with multiple consultation rooms, select one at random and observe whether sharps waste, infectious waste and non-infectious general waste are segregated into three different bins."
"The bins should be color-coded and/or clearly labelled, no more than three quarters (75%) full, and each bin should not contain waste other than that corresponding to its label."
Bins should be appropriate to the type of waste they are to contain; sharps containers should be puncture-proof and others should be leak-proof.
Bins for sharps waste and infectious waste should have lids.
Core Environmental Cleaning Questions Environmental cleaning (herein referred to as cleaning) is an essential part of infection prevention and control.
"Trying to assess whether a service area is considered clean is very subjective, and visibly clean may be very different from microbiologically clean."
"Similarly, frequency of cleaning is difficult to measure because it cannot be observed by enumerators in one day and responses are likely to be subject to respondent bias."
"How frequently a facility needs to be cleaned is linked to patient load, therefore cleaning schedules varies greatly from facility to facility."
Protocols may or may not be written 5a.
"Protocols should include: Step-by-step techniques for specific tasks, such as cleaning a floor, cleaning a sink, cleaning a spillage of blood A cleaning roster or schedule specifying responsibility for cleaning tasks and frequency at which they should be The term for protocols may differ according to local practice; they may be referred to as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), guidelines, instructions, etc."
"Where possible, protocols should be observed by the enumerator."
Question 5b asks whether staff with responsibility for cleaning (either dedicated cleaners or multi-tasking) and whether they have been trained.
"Yes, all have been trained No, some but not all have been trained No, none have been trained No, there are no staff responsible for cleaning Staff responsible for cleaning refers to non-health care providers such as cleaners, orderlies or auxiliary staff, as well as health care providers who, in addition to their Training refers to structured training plans or programs led by a trainer or appropriately qualified supervisor."
Questions 6a asks about the cleaning protocols and schedules and whether they are being routinely used in cleaning.
What proportion of functional toilets were accessible to patients during a normal operating day?
Design Outcomes: New facilities are constructed with appropriate WASH services and maintenance systems are in place.
Climate Resilience Outcomes: Resilient water and sanitation services and hygiene Monitoring and evaluation data in real time (Continuous Quality Improvement) Case studies and practical experiences Program Lessons Learned - open conversation about challenges and failures Best Practices for technical audiences Costing information (*serious gap in WASH in HCF literature) Approach to sustainability Reporting of progress in the implementation of WASH in HCFs should be done monthly by the section heads to the health facility in charges.
"Data Collection Tools and Sources Facility assessment surveys, supported by international organizations, are likely to be the main source of data for WASH in HCF, followed by national Health Management Information Systems (HMIS)."
"The most common health care facility surveys are the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA)26, the Service Delivery Indicators survey (SDI)27, the Service Provision Assessment (SPA)28, Preventing Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA 2020)29 and the Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care assessment (Em."
"They are designed to be conducted periodically and may consist of either a census of all health care facilities, or a random sample from a master list of all health care facilities."
"Proportion of facilities with basic water, sanitation, hygiene, health care waste management, and environmental Proportion of health care facilities... SURVEY NAME, YEAR (note if data were observed or with an improved water supply located within 500 meters with an improved water supply on premises with an improved water supply with water available with water available from an improved water supply located on with improved toilets which are usable with improved toilets which are dedicated for staff with improved toilets which are sex- separated with facilities for menstrual hygiene with improved toilets which are accessible for people with with improved toilets which are usable, sex-separated, provide  for menstrual hygiene management, separate for patients and staff, and accessible for people with limited mobility*"
Surface water (River/Lake/Canal)No water source Other: Main water source is on premises:Yes.
Off premises but up to 500 m. More than 500 m Water from main source is currently available:Yes.
"No Female toilets have facilities to manage menstrual hygiene needs (covered bin, and/or At least one toilet accessible to people with limited mobility:Yes."
"Sharps, infectious and general waste are safely separated into three bins in consultation room:Yes."
"Somewhat (bins are full, include other waste, or only 1 or 2 available)No 13."
"Protocols for cleaning (floor, sink, spillage of blood or bodily fluid) and cleaning schedule are 16."
All staff responsible for cleaning have received training:Yes.
Many guidelines have evidently been existent but implementation has been a very big challenge.
"Policy 1999, have been formulated to facilitate implementation of the WASH guidelines as intended.They neither replace the legal systems within the country nor the health sector but rather are meant to complement them."
"There is a need therefore, to specififcally look at all the pieces of legislation in regards to the technical teams and taskforces to ensure that duplicity of duties is taken care of as it appears frequently in the Public Health Act and PILS."
"It is recommended that the enacting bodies of these taskforces all be bound into one so that the statutes are uniform, this will reduce on conflicts in regards to Accounting, managing of funds and supervision."
This may require setting of rules with dos and donts and bye-laws as necessary with consequences of non-compliance.
"Article 2 - section 2 provides that the constitution is the supreme law of the land and any other law that is inconsistent with any of its provisions, the constitution shall prevail."
"As a result of Decentralization, local governments and rulers below them were given powers to create laws to cover gaps that were not catered for by the main laws (Bye-laws)."
Bye-laws therefore are Laws set by local Government administrators under the Local Government Act to regulate the implementation and operation of WASH in HCFs in particular.
Subtopic 13.1 is to the effect that the policy objective is to review and develop the relevant legal instruments that govern and regulate health and health-related activities in the country in order to ensure that principles and objectives of this policy are attained.
"Whereas this guideline is going to be widely distributed its possible that processes and procedures for compliance had not been well laid out, and for that matter, before documenting enforcement, compliance mechanisms shall precede."
There will be eleven fundamental elements of an effective compliance program: Implementing written policies; Conducting sensitization; Designating compliance officers and compliance committees to provide program oversight (partly done since IPC committees already exist) Use of due diligence in Educating employees and developing effective lines of communication; Holding competitions on identified items;
"Conducting internal monitoring and evaluation; Holding observation weeks; Offering support for such identified areas of weakness to ensure WASH activities are done ( for example if health workers are failing in their duties due to community insubordination, the Local government, community leadership in collaboration with the health teams may work together to sort such a challenge and later task the immediate family, especially children to offer the relevant support); Enforcing standards through well publicized disciplinary guidelines; Responding promptly to detect the offences and undertaking corrective action."
"Basing on the seven fundamental elements above, additional duties and responsibilities of recommended as detailed below: Obligation of Medical Councils To review disciplinary guidelines at least annually with the respective health workers and information should be readily available to review, so that employees are well aware To handle queries and reports of noncompliance with set guidelines and code of Additional Qualifications, Roles and Responsibilities of Health Inspectors and WASH / IPC Committees as Compliance Managers: Qualifications of a Health Inspectorate The Health inspectorate should be very familiar with the practices operational and compliance activities e.g."
"The Appointing as well as the delegating officers must note that delegative leadership is a type which can easily lead to the lowest productivity among group members, therefore checks and balances are a must for maximum productivity and efficiency."
"Designating compliance Officers and committees to provide oversight The Health Inspectors shall be given the mandate to oversee WASH/IPC activities, and shall therefore be the Compliance Officers, (Ref to Bullet 2 below) The WASH/IPC committees shall become the Compliance Committees as in the roles and responsibilities under the institutional framework There shall be use of due diligence in delegation of activities"
Consequences for non-compliance Consequences for non-compliances with the set rules are necessary for the regulations to be of the intended effect.
Consequences may include warning to first time offenders or penalties involving fines to habitual offenders.
"Where offences of commission or omission in relation to the implementation and mis-management of WASH programmes and mishandling of WASH facilities in HCFs are determined by the HCF Management Committees, the culprit(s) shall be held liable with consequences and penalties in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Offences of non-compliance with these guidelines may, in case of medical practitioners, be subject to provisions of the National Health Policy ."
Enforcing councils have already been established for legal action as empowered by the Second National Health Policy and with this dot.com era all is readily available.
"Article 28 provides for the right to a fair hearing which is to the effect that an accused person should be given time and space to defend themselves, Articles 42 and 44 of the"
"The Disciplinary committees should ensure consistent and timely discipline after all investigations confirm violation Where the worst comes to the worst, criminal cases may be instituted against the medical practitioners under sections  and 228 for negligence when treating or carrying out surgeries on a person."

"Undertaking continuous training and capacity building for health workers, improving maternal, neonatal and child health services at all levels of care, strengthening emergency medical service and referral system and improved capacity for operation and maintenance of medical equipment are among the interventions to ensure increased access to nationally coordinated health services."
"Oxygen therapy is vital for addressing hypoxaemia, a condition prevalent in various health issues such as pneumonia, sepsis, malaria, obstructed labour, caesarean sections, birth asphyxia, and more recently, COVID-19."
"This is evidenced by the launch of the first ever 5-year National Implementation Plan for medical oxygen scale up in 2019, substantial financial investments, establishing systems and infrastructure for increasing access to medical oxygen beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Building upon experiences gained over the previous five years, including lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Health has successfully crafted a new National Implementation Plan for Medical Oxygen A well designed and functional medical oxygen ecosystem is essential in effectively managing hypoxaemia."
The purpose of this plan is to consolidate the progress achieved over the past five years and establish sustainable systems that enhance oxygen programming for more effective outcomes in alignment with the National Health Strategy.
"Specifically, the plan aims to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with hypoxaemia through five key objectives: (i) to strengthen hypoxaemia diagnosis, management and improve oxygen utilization; (ii) to strengthen medical oxygen supply systems including implementation plans for oxygen-related equipment at national, district and health facility levels; (iii) to strengthen coordination and management of the medical oxygen systems at national, district and health facility levels; (iv) to strengthen routine medical oxygen data collection and management information systems for surveillance of hypoxaemia and medical oxygen access; (v) to mobilize resources for strengthening medical oxygen systems at national, district and health facility levels."
"The National Implementation Plan for Medical Oxygen Scale up 2023/24-2027/28 is a result supported the process, both financially and technically."
"Teams and health facilities who cooperated extensively to make sure the review and update of the National Implementation Plan for Medical Oxygen Scale up occurred comprehensively and ensured that the final policy document is in line with national and We also extend sincere gratitude to all the United Nations agencies, particularly United Organizations, especially the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), PATH, FREO2, FHI360, Management Sciences for Health (MSH) and Strengthening Supply Chain Systems Activity (SSCS) for their support in reviewing, revising and updating the National Implementation Plan for Medical Oxygen Scale up."
This implementation is aligned with other relevant government plans as follows.
It emphasizes the priorities of the National Development Plan 2020//25 which has priorities to strengthen human capital for social services including health and to promote local manufacturing.
Other relevant projects described in the NDP relevant to this plan are digital transformation that includes increased ICT penetration and digitalization of government business.
"More importantly, this implementation plan is in alignment with the Medical Equipment Guidelines 2020//25, the health infrastructural development plan 2020//25 and all relevant plans as it emphasizes key interventions with regard to medical oxygen systems in the areas of governance, management and coordination, human resource capacity development, adequate access of safe and quality medicines and health technologies, functional and appropriate health infrastructure and logistical capacity."
"This implementation plan reiterates the centrality of Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 DFFHVVWR of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), and the emphasis of medical oxygen as an essential medicine has been further expounded in the GUDIWPHPEHUVWDWHVUHVROXWLRQWRLQFUHDVHDFFHVV 1.2 Importance of reliable medical oxygen systems Low oxygen levels in blood, also referred to as hypoxaemia, occurs in many acute and chronic disease conditions across the life course and contributes to their severity and mortality."
Medical oxygen is a life-saving essential medicine that has no substitute and remains out of reach for many hypoxemic patients.
The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the inadequate affordability and sustainability of medical oxygen nationally where the inordinately large Oxygen in the market is available for industrial and medicinal use.
Industrial oxygen may contain impurities and harmful contaminants and should not be inhaled as medicinal oxygen.
"Delivery of Oxygen for patient administration is done using cylinders (bedside/manifold) filled by any of the above sources, by on-demand production during administration (i.e."
"As such, efforts to streamline its coordination at all levels and integrate into the national back-bone health commodity supply chain led by the National Medical Stores have gained traction and remain important priorities going forward."
"Generalized absence of robust storage infrastructure for Oxygen cylinders in health facilities leading to gross damages and contamination of stored Oxygen and cylinders Weak coordination framework for the countrys Oxygen supply chain system  with unclear roles and responsibilities, low technical/institutional capacity, no order management systems, and poorly funded management activities Lack of funds for procurement of Oxygen supplies needed for proper patient care by health High proportion of non-functional Oxygen therapy and production equipment (including PSA plants) that are not regularly serviced/maintained due to very low maintenance budgets and sharp shortage of competent biomedical engineers/technicians."
"To effectively ensure oxygen supply to all levels of care, it is critical to consider a revised supply mix as illustrated below."
"NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MEDICAL OXYGEN SCALE UP 2023//281.3.3 Human Resources For a well-functioning medical Oxygen system in the country various cadres are needed to manage various critical components as listed below: National oxygen sub-committee with representation from all relevant Pharmacy, HID, EMS, PHE, MCH, DHI, NMS, JMS, UHF, Partners, etc with dedicated chairperson(s) at the level of Assistant Commissioner above."
A consultant was onboarded for the evaluation of the national medical oxygen scaleup plan led by the Oxygen Task Force and subsequent development of a new plan.
"An evaluation tool was thematically developed using specific objectives, pre-tested and rolled out in 85 selected health facilities ranging from NRHs, RRHs, GHs, HCIVs to Private Not for Profit Results from the evaluation were presented to the Working Group and disseminated in a national stakeholder engagement meeting."
"Since the inception of the scale up plan, some steps have been made towards meeting initially set targets."
"The data has been collated from desk, policy, and field reviews."
Major updates to targets were informed by a recent MOH field evaluation of 85 facilities conducted in 2022.
"NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MEDICAL OXYGEN SCALE UP 2023//282.1.1 Objective-based performance review Objective 1: To provide a national strategic framework to guide scale up of oxygen supply and The national oxygen scale-up plan is housed under the Technical Working Group, however there is no dedicated team to oversee implementation of the plan."
"At the subnational level, there is no clear ownership of the oxygen supply chain ecosystem."
Medical oxygen is on the Essential Medicines and Health Supplies (EMHS) list and is now integrated into existing structures and processes for management of essential medicines.
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, an Oxygen Task Force was established to oversee the general operation and management of the oxygen supply chain."
"Membership was drawn from the systems beyond the pandemic, in accordance with the national scale-up plan."
"Hypoxaemia and oxygen stock management indicators were developed and piloted and have been successfully incorporated into the HMIS Monthly Reporting Tool as an addendum, which is captured in DHIS2."
National rollout of the addendum is ongoing.
There is not yet a formalized system to track oxygen supply and access at the national or subnational level.
"Between 2019 and 2022, the total number of pulse oximeters and concentrators at facilities increased by a factor of four, there was an eight-fold increase in the number of oxygen cylinders."
This was largely due to COVID investments and N/RRHs were the greatest beneficiaries.
"As a result of the recent oxygen equipment procurements, over 90% of the available oxygen equipment is functional."
"However, the ABG machines are not in use, due to lack of human resources and/or consumables."
Most of these are at RRHs and are currently non-functional for lack of human resources.
"Again, most of the high flow oxygen equipment which rose from 6 in 2019 to 82 in 2022, is at RRHs."
"At RRHs, there are now 117 mechanical"
"However, only 3 Intensive care units are fully functional, at Jinja, Mbarara and Kabale RRHs."
"Wall outlets for piped oxygen rose from 164 to 1684 and there are operational manifold systems at approximately 3% of HCIVs, 59% of GHs, and 86% of RRHs."
"During the COVID-19 pandemic the government recruited dedicated personnel to operate the oxygen plants, however few plant operators were retained beyond the pandemic."
The plant operator cadre has been incorporated into the RRH staffing structure.
"Training modules for the repair and maintenance of various oxygen equipment were developed and used to train 78% of biomedical engineers and 61% of biomedical technicians on oxygen equipment repair and maintenance, and 53% of plant operators on PSA plants and other Only 25% of the stores personnel were trained in oxygen logistics or inventory control in the are operational consistently and 65% of RRH plants refill for health establishments in the Although supply frequency varies, lower-level facilities receive supplies less frequently than once In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government invested in 18 PSA plants (100Nm3/hr) and 2 Cryogenic liquid oxygen storage tanks."
An additional 4 PSA plants (100Nm3/hr) and 4 PSA plants (30Nm3/hr) were procured with support from partners.
Objective 3: To provide a framework for training of staff in health facilities on rational use of oxygen and basic maintenance of equipment.
"Despite this, only 7%, 9% and 11% of nurses, which is far short of the 80% target."
"Overall, hypoxaemia screening and oxygen administration performance is highest at N/RRHs."
"Objective 4: To provide an advocacy instrument to secure funding to support oxygen scale For the fiscal year , 51% of facilities budgeted for medical oxygen services, the average budget was UGX  (for HCIVs), UGX  (for GHs), and UGX (for RRHs)."
There was no transparently described budgeting process.
"Approximately UGX 50Bn was secured from the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria COVID-19 Response Mechanism."

"NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MEDICAL OXYGEN SCALE UP 2023//285.0 Quantification, Costing, and budget It is challenging to estimate the five-year expenses for implementing the National Strategy throughout all 16 health zones due to the vast variation in oxygen needs each institution."
"However, a projected budget based on evidence-based quantifications with some logical assumptions was developed."
The National Medical Oxygen Scale-up plan was costed using the Activity Based Costing focusing on financial and incremental resources required to implement the Medical Oxygen Scale-up strategy.
The National Medical Oxygen Scale-up plan is estimated to require UGX 548.87B / USD 150.38M   over the period of 5 years.
The funding requirement by objective over the 5-year period is as follows.
"NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MEDICAL OXYGEN SCALE UP 2023//285.3.1 Cost Driver Analysis The major cost drivers are highlighted below: Capacity building- interventions to build capacity on maintenance of equipment, oxygen inventory management and the reporting and utilization of high-quality data."
"Oxygen Research and Innovation Oxygen utility cost-power consumption (production equipment) The interventions designed to optimize functionality of equipment (production and delivery) were allocated 43% of the resource estimates, while interventions to ensure increased access and availability of oxygen to all levels of care down to HC III including Private facilities & Ambulances were allocated 15.2 % of resource estimates."
"In addition, the interventions focused on procurement of equipment (production, diagnostic and delivery) were allocated 14.4 % of resource estimates, whereas the interventions to build capacity on maintenance of equipment, oxygen inventory management and the reporting and utilization of high-quality use of data for oxygen were allocated 9.5 % of the resource estimates."
"As it stands, the National Medical Oxygen Scale-up plan has a funding gap of US $107.83 over the planned 5-year period."
NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MEDICAL OXYGEN SCALE UP 2023//286.0 Monitoring and evaluation The MOH will oversee an annual planning exercise at the national level to assess progress toward the scale-up strategy's goals and pinpoint initiatives to which funding should be properly allocated.

"Over the years, the medical equipment policy, health facility equipment lists, and equipment specifications have been reviewed and updated in 2000, 2003 and 2009, to conform to the health sector strategic plan, technological advancements and medical techniques."
"Among the methodologies introduced in these guidelines are; innovative procurement options such as hire purchase, placement and managed equipment contracts."
These mechanisms will improve access to state-of-the-art medical equipment and set a good foundation for a more efficient and sustainable healthcare delivery system.
"Their dedication and expertise have resulted in a document that reflects our aspirations, but also embodies the collective wisdom of our healthcare As we embark on this new chapter, Icall upon all stakeholders in the health sector to embrace and implement the principles listed in these guidelines."
This is the first edition of the National Medical Equipment Guidelines produced by the Mo.
Guidance has been provided on innovative medical equipment acquisition and management options (e.g.
"Emphasis has been placed on ensuring that acquisition of equipment is based on planning and needs  assessment that establishes; need, availability of human resource, infrastructure and utilities to ensure full utilization of equipment."
Inspection and verification of new equipment is an important function in the equipment acquisition process to confirm conformity to minimum national and contract specifications.
"For equipment to be used to its full capacity and lifespan, there is need to ensure adequate funds are budgeted, and allocated for operation and maintenance."
The expert input of the various NACME sub-committee members is most appreciated.
Their experience and professionalism were instrumental in preparing the health facility equipment lists and equipment specifications.
Deogratius Katesigwa is deeply appreciated for his leadership and support in steering NACME as an individual consultant throughout the development of these guidelines.
The National Medical Equipment Guidelines have a revised standardized list of equipment and furniture for different healthcare levels including selected specialized facilities.
"Effort was made to align the equipment lists with the requirements of the National Health Policy 2021, Mo."
"For ease of reference and use; the following health facility equipment lists, and equipment specifications have been prepared separately: HCII/CHEWs Station, HCIII, HCIV, GH, RRH and NRH."
Medical equipment is a substantial asset in the healthcare delivery system and needs to be managed efficiently and effectively.
"The way in which it is purchased, managed and used influences the quality of healthcare delivery."
Medical equipment may also pose risks to patients and staff if not used properly.
"On the basis of the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) carried out on medical equipment management, it was agreed to develop comprehensive National Medical Equipment Guidelines; to guide equipping, use and management of equipment in health facilities."
"The aim of the National Medical Equipment Guidelines is to align medical equipment acquisition and management with current international, regional and national healthcare delivery strategies and commitments; so as to address current and emerging socioeconomic challenges."
"The private health sector is comprised of Private Not for Profit (PNFP), Private Health Practitioners (PHPs), and Traditional Contemporary Medicine Practitioners (TCMPs)."
"H functions are delegated to National Autonomous Institutions like NDA, UNHRO and NMS."
"Health services delivery is divided into national, regional, district and health sub-districts."
"The health facilities are designated from Health Centre two (HCII)/Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) Station, Health Centre three (HCIII), Health Centre four Note: As HCIIs are phased out and/or upgraded to HCIIIs, health infrastructure at HCIIs will be used by the CHEWs to deliver community-based Healthcare in line with CHEWs The services provided at each Healthcare level are indicated in the"
"In addition to services offered at HCIV, other general services are provided."
"In addition to services offered at the general services are offered such as; Psychiatry, Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT), Ophthalmology, Dentistry, Intensive care, radiology, pathology and higher-level surgery."
These provide comprehensive specialist services.
"In addition, they are involved in teaching and research."
"While the need for improved medical equipment management practice has long been recognized and addressed at numerous international fora, health facilities in developing countries continue to have challenges of inadequate equipment and/or non-functioning medical equipment resulting from improper planning, inappropriate equipment placement; poorly organized and managed healthcare technical services and a shortage of skilled personnel."
"The situation is similar for other physical infrastructure assets such as buildings, plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, communication and information systems, catering and laundry equipment, waste disposal and vehicles."
This is the case for a NRH setting with sophisticated lifesupport equipment or HCII/CHEWs station where simple equipment is needed for effective diagnosis and safe treatment of patients.
"What is important at all levels, is availability of"
"Use of Medical Equipment in Health Facilities Medical equipment comprises all medical devices connected to patients to provide treatment and care, and instruments used for diagnostic or therapeutic services."
"Medical equipment is used for the following purposes: Prevention: protecting against disease by preventing or reducing the risk of its occurrence or reoccurrence, or limiting its severity, e.g., cold chain equipment and Screening: detecting diseases or abnormality, or determining risk factors associated with these asymptomatic populations, e.g., mammography for breast cancer, prostatespecific antigen testing for prostate cancer and colorectal cancer screening devices Diagnosis: identifying the cause and nature or extent of disease, e.g., CT scan for head injuries and glucose monitoring tests for diabetes."
Increased access to electricity and rapid advancement in medical equipment technology have resulted in sophisticated equipment being deployed in lower-level health facilities to enhance their diagnostic and treatment capabilities.
Medical equipment management capacity is still low in the public health facilities especially at the lower-level health facilities.
"Over the last three decades, approaches to healthcare and patient management have changed dramatically as result of the remarkable progress made in health technology development, emergence of new diseases, diagnostic methods and issuance of new WHO treatment guidelines."
"The important role technology plays in medicine is evident in every contributed to increasing life expectancy, greater diagnostic precision, less time needed for investigations, treatment, rehabilitation and consequently less stress to patients."
The WHO estimates that up to 60% of medical equipment in developing countries may not be in service at any given time.
"In the Health Sector, the main issues of concern with equipment use and management are; Improper use, operation, care and handling of equipment."
"The National Health Policy emphasizes good quality healthcare, through cost-effective interventions, targeted at the most important health problems of the population, with an optimal mix of appropriate health technologies and trained human resources, which are affordable and sustainable."
"Today, delivery of modern healthcare services heavily depends The National Medical Equipment Guidelines , provide guidance on equipment acquisition, specifications, norms and standards set out in the Medical Equipment Policy The guidelines emphasize appropriate, daily, routine and corrective equipment maintenance, to achieve a safe and cost-effective equipment management system."
H is to have a healthy and productive population that contributes to socio-economic growth and national development.
The aim Ensure adequate supply of medical equipment and improve diagnostic capacity in health facilities at all levels of service delivery; and non-facility-based points of Ensure availability and access to appropriate equipment for delivery of disability friendly health services.
"For each healthcare level, a list of recommended equipment has been developed by NACME to support delivery of the designated healthcare services at that level."
A consolidated summary of recommended equipment for each Healthcare level (herein referred to as the Medical Equipment Master List) is attached as Annex 1.
"Targeted Users of the Guidelines These Guidelines are for use by the following public and private institutions, and officers involved in medical equipment procurement and management: Heads of Autonomous Health Institutions and Private Health Facilities."

"Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in HCFs indicators are presented at four service levels of access including; a) no service at all, b) limited access, c) basic access and d) advanced level access to services."
Data presented in the report was collected from a total of government and Private Not for Profit (PNFP) HCFs across 136 districts between a two-year period (by the support from UNICEF and Water.
"Data was analysed using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, mean and standard deviations for continuous data."
"Composite scores for access to water, sanitation, hand hygiene, waste management, HCFs cleanliness and environmental cleanliness were generated."
Global Positioning System (GPS) spatial data was entered into an excel sheet and imported into Arc.
"Across the country, WASH services in many government and PNFP HCFs were insufficient."
"Data from 136 districts indicate that 17 per cent of all HCFs dont have access to safe water at all (no service), per cent are limited, 60 per cent are basic and 1 per cent are advanced."
"Access to sanitation was estimated at almost 10 per cent of all HCFs without access, 81 per cent limited, 5 per cent basic and only 4 per cent at advanced level."
"Relatedly, 11 per cent of all HCFs did not have access to hand hygiene at all, 21 per cent limited, 46 per cent basic and 21 per cent advanced services."
"Similarly, another per cent of all HCFs did not have access to environmental cleanliness at all across the country, 40 per cent were limited and per cent basic and 21 per cent advanced."
"Access to safe medical waste management was estimated at 23 per cent advanced, 56 per cent basic, 18 per cent limited and 3 per cent no service at all."
"Disparities between districts for particular services was widest for medical waste management and environmental cleanliness with districts like Lamwo and Obongi having access to safe medical waste management estimated at 83 per cent and 71 per cent at advanced level while Nwoya and Iganga were estimated at 70 per cent and 66 per cent for environmental cleanliness at advanced level compared to Dokolo, Namutumba and Bulisa with no HCFs with access to both environmental cleanliness and safe medical waste management at advanced service level."
The WASH in HCFs funding gap to close the access disparities from limited/no services to advanced was big (approximately UGX 656 billion) but achievable with careful and systematic planning.
Access to sanitation services were extremely low while others were non-existent in some districts hence needing urgent attention at Urgent actions at national and facility level are needed to improve WASH conditions in healthcare facilities.
These actions may include: 1.
"Implementation of national standards may benefit from a tiered or laddered approach that allows healthcare facilities to make incremental progress towards, and eventually beyond, a basic level of service."
Support construction of WASH infrastructure in HCFs to improve quality of care and infection prevention control.
H should mobilize partners to support and provide a complete package for WASH services in healthcare facilities.
The WASH in HCF costed plans should be integrated in the district plans to
Presented in the report is the national WASH in HCFs coverage situation.
"It is code named the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Healthcare Facilities (WASH in HCFs) report."
"WASH in HCFs indicators are presented at four service levels of access including; a) no service at all, b) limited, c) basic and d) advanced level access to services."
"See Presented in the report are national, regional and district analyses of WASH in HCFs using data collected by from  healthcare facilities across 136 districts in the country."
District specific analyses and costed plans are presented in the Background to the project.
"Functional WASH services contribute to reduction in disease, improved occupational health, more efficient healthcare services, improved staff morale and performance, the sustained ability to provide safe care, and increased trust in healthcare services."
Primary healthcare facilities are often the first point of care in rural settings and play a key role in outbreak prevention.
This is not possible without proper WASH facilities and prevention of contamination of water.
WHO and UNICEF have proposed an action plan to achieve universal WASH coverage in HCFs by 2030.

"Toilet facilities are unimproved (pit latrines without a slab or platform, hanging latrines and bucket latrines), or there are no toilets or latrines at the facility."
"To establish viable targets for WASH in HCFs, investigation beyond access is needed to address the state of WASH infrastructure and service provision."
Patient and caregiver use of WASH services is largely unaddressed in previous studies despite being critical for Different stakeholders have conducted studies on WASH in healthcare facilities in different regions but these did not cover the entire country and only had limited utility.

Bins should be appro priate to the type of waste they are to contain; sharps containers should be puncture-proof and others should be leak-proof (lined).
Bins for sharps waste and infectious waste should have lids.
"If waste removed off site, both the site and the holding area (minus the pit) should comply with the above requirements."
WASH related gaps in HCFs and costing as well as the respective district summaries have been presented in the annexes.
"Data has been segregated based on the level of the healthcare facilities, regional and ownership regime, rural and urban divide and service levels."
"Healthcare facility socio-demographic characteristics Across the country, data from a total of  [3187 government and 1085 PNFPs] HCFs was analyzed."
Of these  (31.3 per cent) were Health Centre II; 1566 (33.6 per cent) Health Centre (HC) III; 213 (5 per cent) Health Centre IVs; 218 (5.1 per cent) () HCFs were found in rural areas and 29.3 per cent () HCFs were located in urban areas.
There were more staff on average in PNFPs compared to government HCFs estimated at an average of 21 and 15 respectively.
"Relatedly, more HCF workers were more concentrated in urban compared to rural areas at an estimated average of 14 and 11 respectively."
"Across the regions, Teso (1.6 per cent), Bunyoro (1.5 per cent), West Nile (1.2 per cent) and Kampala (1.2 per cent) had the highest number of HCFs with advanced access to water while Kigezi, Karamoja, Bukedi, Bugishu and Ankole did not have a single HCF with access to water at advanced level."
"At total of 119 districts with Zombo, Terego and Pakwach being the last on the list in ascending order respectively did not have a single HCF with access to water at advanced level."

"Less than one in every 10 (4.1 per cent) HCFs had access to sanitation services at advanced level, 4.7 per cent at basic, 81.5 per cent at limited and 9.7 per cent dont have access to sanitation at all."
"Relatedly, Teso and Karamoja did not have any HCF with advanced access to sanitation."
"Across districts, Kampala (34.1 per cent), Adjumani (18.8 per cent) and Nakaseke (11.5 per cent) had the highest number of HCFs with access to sanitation services A total of 94 districts across the country did not have a single HCF with access to sanitation at advanced level with Zombo and Terego districts bottom on the list."
The district-based ranking in terms of access to sanitation across HCFs is indicated in
Lango and Acholi have the least number of HCFs with advanced access to effective hand hygiene estimated at 7.5 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively.
Almost in very 10 districts  across the country did not have any HCF with access to effective hand hygiene services.
"Zombo, Koboko and Ntoroko districts were bottom of this list."
"A total of 14 districts did not have a single HCF with advanced access to advanced environmental cleanliness with Koboko, Ntoroko and Bundibugyo districts bottom on the list."
"Relatedly, across the districts, Lamwo (82.8 per cent), Obongi (70.6 per cent) and Koboko (69.2 per cent) were ranked as leading with the highest number of HCFs with advanced access to safe medical waste management and disposal."
A total of two districts including Dokolo and Bulisa did not have any HCF with access to safe medical waste management and disposal services.
Using agreed rates (between from no service/limited to basic and advanced service levels respectively are presented in estimate which can give a good snapshot of what to expect while providing WASH in HCFs.
Some costs may vary from district to district due to accessibility and other factors of doing business.

"However, when counted individually, a total of 247 partners were supporting the various district HCFs in WASH. UNICEF and World Vision International were the leading partners across the districts supporting above 20 districts each."
"Across the districts, some districts had more partners than others; for example; Kanungu and Kampala had the highest number of partners (27 and 23 respectively) compared to districts like Kibaale which did not have any partner for WASH in HCFs in the district."
"Across the country, WASH services in many government and PNFP HCFs are insufficient."
"Access to effective hand hygiene and environmental cleanliness are among the least accessed WASH Large disparities between HCFs level, districts, location, regions and ownership regimes sharply exist in access to WASH in HCFs with disparities between districts being the widest."
The funding gap for WASH in HCFs to close the access disparities from limited/no services to advanced is big (approximately UGX billion) but achievable with careful and systematic planning.

"The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM These guidelines are designed to support the delivery of social services by government, Non-State Actors and all citizens at parish, village and household level."
The guidelines are in consonance with the PDM spirit of: clarifying the services at parish level; updating the Service Delivery Standards at Parish level for the relevant MDAs in line with the whole Government approach and the NDP III programme planning and budgeting approach.
Following these guidelines is expected to improve the delivery and quality of social services for all citizens.
"The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM The process of developing the Parish Development Model (PDM) - Social Services Pillar Implementation Manual has been consultative and participatory in nature involving all key stakeholders in social services delivery (health, education, water expresses heartfelt thanks to each and every one that made an input in having this document in place."
"Specifically, great appreciation is due to the Pillar Working Group and staff of the PDM secretariat, Education and Sports and, Special thanks to H.Ethe President for providing the vision and guidance to the country in the design and commitment of resources for the PDM as a strategic initiative of Government."
"We equally acknowledge the institutions which provided the much-desired data and information on social Finally, we appreciate the PDM Secretariat coordinating all stakeholders and ensuring that the pillar vision is delivered to the market standards and even By: Pillar Four Managers and PDM Secretariat Attache"
"It is an extension of the whole-ofgovernment approach to development as envisaged under the Third National Development Plan 2019//2025 (NDPIII), with the Parish as the lowest administrative and operational hub for delivering services closer to the people and foster local economic development."
"The overall objective is to increase the effectiveness of the interaction between the government and its people, in order to accelerate the transformation."
"The PDM has seven pillars that also anchor with the NDPIII and Vision 2040 and these are illustrated below: Source: PDM Implementation Guidelines, 2022"
The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM Overview of the Social Services Pillar Social services are a range of activities intended to keep members of a community healthy and well.
These services are enablers in the attainment of better quality of life for 2.
The pillar is equally anchored on the following policies: The Third National Health Policy 2023; the Teacher Policy 2021; the Water Policy 1999; the Equal Opportunities Commission Policy 2006 and; the National Social Protection Policy 2015 among others.
The objectives of the social services pillar are: To provide a framework for leadership and coordination of the pillar efforts at Parish and village level; 2.
To establish an effective mechanism through which the available resources are leveraged at Parish and Village level; 3.
"Decisions and actions under the PDM will be driven by data collected, analysed and evaluated from and by the Ensuring that communities are part of the solutions to local social problems in order to sustain the development"
Community and family members are allocated a cardinal role in determining the basket and quality of social services that they need for Please note that: the guidelines in the manual do not negate other implementation guidelines provided by Government on social services delivery but rather provides a common ground for implementation of such services  with community and household members being at the centre stage of services delivery.
How this manual has been developed
"These interventions are the parish level, limited Source: Mo."
The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM Below is the situation of the operational delivery of the three social services at parish and village level.
The literacy rate was higher for males (81%) than females (72%) in 2019/20.
It is through the key features of socioeconomic status of the country and its livelihood.
"In addition, government has promoted participation of the private sector in the provision of education."
Enrolment at the tertiary level now stands at about  of which  are attending universities.
"The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM aggregate impact of all this is an increase in literacy rate (of persons aged 10 years and above) from 70% in FY2012/13 to 74% in 2016/17, and average years of schooling from 4.7 in FY2012/13 to 6.1 in FY2016/17 (NDP 2."
"Currently, 42% of all districts have at least one government-aided technical and vocational institution providing varying levels of skills development."
Most public schools are under threat by individuals who are mercilessly grabbing land that would serve the learning purpose better.
"However, majority have failed to support the feeding of their children at schools."
"Besides, the situation is worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and acute food shortages which have rendered communities helpless."
"A school feeding programme should take cognizance of: the quality, quantity, nutritional value and safety of the meal provided at school."
"The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM Care in Education (ECD) is left in the hands of individuals, Non."
"Whereas government is supposed to support: actual service provision, financing, training and, regulation, the concentration is currently on training and 2."
"By 2019, there were  (34.5%) operational pre-primary schools of which only  (14.6%) were registered."
This implies a deficit of  pre-primary schools which are required to serve the eligible but underserved learners population .
"The matter is complicated by the high concentration of ECD providers in urban and peri-urban areas, denying rural populations of access."
"The attainment of quality ECCE is constrained by several challenges namely: (a) Limited access to ECCE services; (b) Ineffective regulation of ECCE delivery; (c) Lack of knowledge on the value of quality ECCE engagement; (e) Uncoordinated efforts in ECCE delivery; (f) High poverty levels; (g) High cost of ECCE services; and (h) Limited access to Equal access to Technical, Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Government recognizes that effective technical skills are vital for the individual, enterprise and the economy since they lead to self-reliance at the household level, increased productivity, profits and higher incomes for the nation."
"There has been an increase in the number of girls accessing education, at the level of entry, particularly for primary schooling which is almost reaching the 50/50 mark."
"The National Population and Housing Census Report  indicated that,  ( males and,  females) were persons with disabilities aged between 6-12 years and rightly contributing to the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)2 in primary education."
"However, the 2017 education sector data indicated that  ( males and, females) were enrolled in primary schools leading to a Net Enrolment Ratio (NER)3 of 28.6% (29.9% males and, 27.2% females) hence leaving Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER): for Primary: refers to the proportion of pupils attending primary schools (P1-P7) to the number of children aged 6-12 in the entire population."
Net Enrolment Ratio (NER): is the ratio of primary school children aged 6-12 years to the number of children of the same age range in the population.
The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM out an entire 71.4% of potential learners with disabilities who would have been enrolled in primary schools.
"It should be noted that the with a population estimate of  for the 6-12-year-old ( male; female), it translates into a GER of 109% (107% male and 111% female) and NER of 91% (89% male and 93% female)."
"Again, whereas the government new strategy on education of children with disabilities is that of inclusive education approach, there are challenges associated with: skill set of teachers, high cost of special centres, limited access to learning materials and generally negative attitudes towards learners with disabilities by schools, parents and fellow learners."
"Literacy, adult and community education Although there has been an increase in the literacy rates from 54 percent in 1992 to 72.2 percent in 2014 (increase of 18.2 percent) a significant population of youth and adults are still illiterate."
"The current adult education programmes of government under the enhancement; Village Savings and Loans Association; livelihoods and business development skills support; Community Learning Centres however are not yet popular, the integration of such programmes is highly politicised and, fewer men participate in such programmes and yet they are the key decision makers."
The Community Learning Centres have equally been seized in some areas or changed into other service
The situation of the above is described herein below: Community Health Service Delivery The National Community Health Strategy 2022 prescribes a set of health services that are to be offered at village and parish levels.
These are linked to the Essential Health Care Package and the PHC components.
"The community health workforce (village and parish) is dominated by the Village Health Teams (VHTs) and, Health"
"In addition, since health prevention and promotion are key, the Village Health Committee (VHC) may environmental health standards."
Currently a set of community health system data generated from the VHT/ICCM register captures data from households and children treated in the community) and compiled into the 097b reported which is entered into the DHIS2.
"The report incorporates data on household summary and Integrated Community Case Management for Childhood Illnesses (ICCM) is integrated into the DHIS2 (Akankunda et al., 2016 & MOH Digital technology innovations have introduced e. Health opportunities for easing data collection, data reporting, data visualization and using real-time data for decision making."
"Similarly, these systems require an adequate literacy level as well as refresher trainings for use which are not well supported by government."
"Commodity distribution in the community is supported by VHTs for ICCM, chlorination, screening and care or management for COVID-19 among others."
All these supplies are provided by decentralized health care services.
"U is $36 per capita, approximately $48 per capita lower than the recommended WHO minimum level of 84 US$ (National Health Accounts (NHA), 2018/ 2019; National Health Policy, 2023)."
"The consultations raised the following in regard to community health financing: repairs and maintenance of essential facilities and equipment; addressing the shortfalls in essential drugs caused by the stock-outs and, non-supplies; addressing possible areas of community contribution and; inadequacies in universal (national) health insurance coverage for all Community Health Participation, Leadership and Governance Communities across the country must be empowered to participate in communities based on the premise that good health starts with, and is created by individuals, their families and the communities, and is supported by the professionals in health."
"The focus for community health participation and engagement recognizes that individuals should have the primary stronger and integrated people-centered Primary Health Care system for promotive, preventive, rehabilitative health services."
"Water and environment are central in contributing towards the countrys drive in increasing household incomes, improved quality of life of the employment and wealth creation."
The sector continues to focus on access to drinking water as well as improved sanitation and sewerage services through increasing point water sources and piped water and sanitation coverage in both urban and rural areas targeting poor households especially those who are yet to be part of the money economy.
The aim is to bring water nearer to the households for improved quality of life and accelerated income generation at household level.
This is being done as an enabler to ensure that the poor households are healthy and productive to attain inclusive money economy strategy as provided for in the Parish Development Model (PDM) framework.
This is an attempt to provide adequate drinking water and corresponding quality at the right time and place in order to contribute to increased household incomes including ensuring the integrity of the water sources through catchment protection and restoration as well as mitigating the effects of climate change.
"Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Safe water coverage stands at 70 percent ( people) that is 68% in rural areas and 71.6% in urban areas."
"Out of the total of  villages in the country,  villages have access to at least one safe water source."
"The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM Despite all the water developments and initiatives, there are still about villages without any safe and clean water source."
This framework builds on the strength of the current Community Based Management System (CBMS) model which has successfully contributed to achieving 85% functionality of rural water supply systems.
"However, there is need for an improved and professional approach to O&Mgiven that the natural sector target for O&Mis 95% as the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG); and looking into the future where higher technology restricts the CBMS model from being a viable approach The improved CBMS is referred to as Community Based Management System Plus (CBMS+)."
"CBMS+ is improved CBMS where an Area Service Provider (ASP) approach is introduced in the O&Mof rural water supply infrastructure to ensure that water supply services are paid for by the all users and the infrastructure is operational all the time through routine preventive maintenance as well as timely repairs of broken down or faulty A community level, water services are administered by the Water User Committee (WUC) who are responsible for mobilising users to pay user fees and; ensure hygiene and sanitation of the water source and troughs."
The country has been experiencing challenges of flooding and rising water levels since .
"Through proactive regulation of water releases at Jinja, and monitoring and forecasting of weather and water levels, the problem of rising water levels has been temporarily managed."
Efforts have been made to reach out to more industries for a bigger impact.
"Surface waters in the country are under threat of pollution from various sources for example; industrial waste discharging toxic metals, storm runoff that carries organic pollution including sediments, pharmaceutical residues, plastic waste, air pollutants."
The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM The national forest cover has increased from 9.5% in 2015 to 13.3% in 2020.
"This has been due to improved management of natural forests in Central Forest Reserves which increased from  ha to  ha, licensing of commercial plantations establishment in Central Forest Reserves (CFRs) where new plantation of  was established."
"In addition, forest cover has increased due the on-going nationwide tree planting programme targeting 40 million trees annually."
There is also general increase in interest for tree planting across the country which has contributed to increased forest cover.
"However, communities have not yet approved the value of community agro-forestry; integrated forestry livelihoods and forestry protection for environmental protection and posterity."
"Wetlands are a source of water for agricultural production, domestic use and, complementation of the eco-system among others."
"These problems are compounded by poverty, low amounts of environmental awareness and low levels of technology."
"The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM Increased demand for wood and other forests products (firewood, threaten to outweigh supplies and turn around the increasing forest This is worsened by rising encroachment which is a big risk for forest investments, development and management due to conversion of forests (public and private) into agricultural and grazing land; 2."
The characteristics of a good service and package of social services (interventions and actions) for each service sector are presented herein below.
Delivering good social services at community level Good service delivery is a vital element of any community.
"The guideline has provided a comprehensive package of services to be In health, the sector shall focus on the comprehensive package on Primary Health Care (PHC) (including preventative, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services and health promotion activities); 2."
Ensure that costs of accessing the services are affordable and does not exceed 8 percent of the household income.
"Ensure that the service providers (teachers, health workers, maintenance and operation and, other technical teams among others) are available on call and their telephones widely shared in the communities for the sole purpose of reaching the service point at service prescribed delivery times."
"The manual prescribes the following: For health: All persons regardless of whether they are well, ill or sick are entitled to the package services; 2."
"For education: All Children in the school going age, non-literate persons aged 15 years and above and are not in position to read and write and all persons (boys, girls, men and women) who have dropped out of school but would benefit from additional skills development and employment through the TVET route and; persons with disabilities and older persons who may benefit from skilling, re-skilling and, life and social skills development among others."
In ensuring continuity of service delivery the following approaches will be employed: A Life-cycle approach: ensuring that the package of services is not missed by a specific age category  such as immunisation and primary education for children.
"These may include: individual impact of illnesses (including pandemics) on service delivery; prevailing situations that might affect effective service delivery (such as floods, lockdowns, illhealth, disruptions in the eco-system among others) and; associated intermittencies in the service delivery continuum and; 3."
"Other supply factors: these may include service availability, market and other economic determinants among others."
"In ensuring Quality of social services at community level, the following shall be adhered to: Person Centred delivery: Services are organized around the person, not the social problem, level of financing or users."
"The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM shall have determination and participation rights as well as obligations in the quality of service that they wish to receive; administration and shared values for service delivery shall be supported communication of policies and guidelines to service points (water points, health and education centres) and, ensuring feedback from the service 3."
The use of community data to improve service delivery will be fronted at all times.
"This, in turn, can lead to better and more informed decision making when it comes to managing service users and other stakeholders (including political, appointed and religious leaders)."
"All primary schools (regardless of ownership) shall have: Qualified teachers and staff in accordance with the education services and Education Service Commission (ESC) staffing standards; Adequate and safe amenities for play, study, feeding and toileting including safe spaces for girls to change sanitary pads; Isolation facility for illnesses;"
The parents and caretakers of children shall ensure that: All children of school going age are enrolled in the mainstream schools.
"Emphasis shall be placed on children with disabilities and other special educational needs; Children attend class unless under conditions of sicknesses and Children have the required scholastic materials  uniforms, books, pens, pencils, mathematical sets and, computers (where applicable) Children have an adequate and nutritious meal at school under an Management Committee (SMCs) and shared with the P4C and PDC."
Schools and partners may suggest avenues and innovative ways of delivering the curriculum; Schools shall not use an examination-based approach to teaching Adequate time should be provided for co-curricular activities and 5.

The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM The process of developing this manual was supported by: UKAID Under Backup Health
National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies This document was developed under the national one health framework.
"Any part of this document may be freely reviewed, quoted or reproduced, or translated in full or in part, provided the source is acknowledged."
"Throughout all the responses to these emergencies, the country has experienced challenges with logistics across the human, animal and environment sectors."
This was demonstrated by the significant dependence on the support from the development partners during recent PHEs.
The approach has guided the response to the PHEs including Ebola Virus Disease outbreaks and the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Stronger emphasis has been put on the principle of the national stockpile and prepositioning to ensure continuous availability and accessibility to Medical Countermeasures, support to deploy personnel and the transportation services We wish to express our appreciation to all those who worked tirelessly to produce this document."
We the undersigned Government Ministries have read and understood the roles and responsibilities of the organizations as outlined in the National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies.
The NAPHS provides a platform for coordination and collaboration to address emerging health threats and improve national health security using a multi-sectorial and One Health approach.
"However, the 2021 Internal Multi-sectorial self-assessment identified a gap in the areas of Medical Countermeasures and The National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies will provide a system to activate and coordinate Medical Countermeasures and personnel during PHEs."
This plan was developed by a technical committee comprising the National One-Health Platform stakeholders.
"Special attention is given to the United States Government, United Nations Agencies including the WHO, FAO, WFP and UNICEF for the support during the development of the plan."
The National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies aims to strengthen the deployment of relevant personnel and to improve access to essential medicines and appropriate technologies during PHE.
"The National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies was established and governed based on the national one-health platform framework which brings together human health, the environment and animal health sectors with key stakeholders from the different Ministries, Agencies (MDAs) that play various roles during any PHE."
"The plan has three components: the Medical Countermeasures supply chain plan, the personnel deployment plan, and case management in alignment with international The Medical Countermeasures supply plan component guides the processes to ensure technologies during PHEs."
"It also includes the policy framework, as well as the roles of different stakeholders from the different The MCM supply chain plan is important in ensuring appropriate selection, quantification, warehousing, distribution, and management of the national stockpile for essential medicines and appropriate technologies during PHE."
"Regulated life-saving medicines and medical supplies that can be used to diagnose, prevent, protect from, or treat conditions associated with chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats, emerging infectious diseases, or a natural disaster1 The system of people, information, processes, and infrastructure that is set up to move materials from its source to where it is consumed by users or patients."
"They include but are not limited to Cholera, Typhoid and 3."
"Objective of the GHSA calls for improved global access to medical countermeasures (MCMs) and establishes as a target, the development of national policy frameworks for sending and receiving MCMs from and to international partners during Public Health Emergencies One of the principal ways governments are trying to counter similar threats is by signing on and actively participating in building capabilities outlined in International Health Regulations (IHR) and acquiring and stockpiling a panoply of  medical countermeasures."
"These are used to prevent, detect and respond to events associated with above mentioned threats and diseases."
"The MCM interventions include ventilators, diagnostics, personal protective equipment (PPE), and patient decontamination supplies; which are critical to preventing, mitigating, or treating the adverse health effects of a public addressing incidents created by the threat or the occurrence of any type of public health emergency that requires distributing MCMs to The plan describes the framework that will allow the One-Health stakeholders to respond to these incidents by identifying the expected procedures, and working relationships for MDAs and development partners during the deployment of MCMs."
"This plan is not an overall response plan to address all public health crisis needs; rather, its focus is on MCM supply chain operations, with the aim of putting a system in place for activating and coordinating medical countermeasures during a public health emergency in accordance to national and international Medical countermeasures are regulated lifesaving medicines and medical supplies that can be used to diagnose, prevent, protect from, or treat conditions associated with chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats, emerging infectious diseases, or a"
"U) to coordinate the forecasting, quantification, procurement, storage, and deployment of  devices, biological products drugs and chemicals that are responsive to public health emergency threats."
"This plan is necessary to assist the MDAs , and districts emergencies that could overwhelm normal medical countermeasure  capabilities."
"The objectives of this plan are: MCM supply chain framework for sustainable availability, accessibility, and utilization of medical countermeasures during PHEs."
During the assessment one of the gaps that the assessment pointed out was the lack of an MCM plan for managing PHEs.
The MCM plan will provide a mechanism to ensure that all sectors have adequate MCMs and personnel to be deployed during the 1.1.5.
"Planning Assumptions In preparation for and response to PHEs, the national mechanisms and institutions should execute their functions to fulfill the specific requirements of the emergency system, as 1."
The commodities for routine use are sufficient to meet the need for routine Public Health interventions and the MCM only applies 4.
Enabling Legal Framework A summary of the legal framework upholding the MCM supply chain activities is as follows: 1.
The Act is mandated to regulate procurement and disposal of public assets.
Safety and Occupation is regulated by Act offer provisions for the healthcare workers safety and wellbeing.
"Primary Response Ministries, The roles and responsibilities of government MDAs, and other stakeholders are listed below: 1."
The MAAIF procurement unit is charged with the procurement and distribution of supplies for PHEs response in the animal sector.
"UPDF will also provide surge capacity, including vehicles, Police Force."
"The private central warehouse, as identified by the different sectors,  will provide surge capacity for the procurement, storage Key roles are; provide and ensure availability of clean and safe water."
They are responsible for detection and response to PHEs.
"Responsible for ensuring that the population has access to safe, efficacious, and cost-effective drugs and for regulating the fast-track importation / exportation of medical supplies and medical 13."
"The resources may include, but not limited to, technical, financial, human resource, logistics, and MCMs."
The Logistics Sub-Committee  (LSC) is one of the sub-committees of the NTF.
Positioned between the NTF and the DTFs are the regional prepositioning centres where MCMs will be positioned for preparedness and response to PHEs.
"At the national level, the line ministries are represented in both the NTF and LSC."
"Where local governments do not have the storage capacity, preparedness supplies for all sectors can be prepositioned in The following is a summary of the roles and responsibilities of organizations that will provide direction during a PHE: 1."
"The NTF will provide direction, guidance and ensure adherence to procedures for MCM 2."
"National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies Roles and responsibilities of organizations during a PHE Roles and responsibilities related to MCM control issues during a PHE are as follows: detection, and response to large-scale PHEs including MCM supply chain operations."
"These structures, policies, and procedures are outlined in the following plans for emergency response and day-to-day operations: a."
The LSC will develop appropriate logistics management information tools for MCMs in PHEs  where needed and train  and  guide actors  on  their use.
"They are responsible for approval of orders from sites and coordinate distribution, warehousing and reporting for the MCMs."
U has access and availability of MCM supplies in a timely manner and in a usable condition to counteract any PHE.
"In conjunction with MDAs procurement units, assess the available MCM supply storage, potential warehouse space if existing storage capabilities are overwhelmed."
"Collaborate with the relevant regulatory authorities to continuously review guidelines fast-tracking acquisition of MCM supplies both locally and internationally, once a PHE has 9."
"Use results of after-action review reports to improve planning, resource mobilization, and management of future PHEs."
"This MCM plan has four distinct phases of Although the plan will deploy much of the same infrastructure, facilities, and human resources of the regular public health system, each phase in the MCM plan has its own objectives, rules, and operational information Authorities will therefore execute this plan along all phases according to the playbook notwithstanding, decision-makers selectively can activate and release MCM supply chain assets to tailor the response to situational"
When the outbreak of infectious disease has been declared the emergency supply chain gets activated.
"This will ensure the safety of staff and should also be extended also to law enforcement personnel (security, UPDF, UPF) irrespective of whether their roles are just providing security during transit, managing public order, etc."
Gathering information: The NRRT will collect information about the PHE and provide a situational report to the NTF.
The LSC will develop an initial incidentspecific MCM requirement list for immediate deployment.
"Distribute MCMs: The NTF will direct the distribution of MCMs to meet the crisis needs; the LSC will oversee the distribution of MCMs through the supply chain; prepositioning centers will hold stocks for preparedness and ensure supplies are replenished to support a PHE response, and the District Rapid Response Team (DRRT) will coordinate with the prepositioning centers and partners when needed to supply the sites with appropriate MCMs for specific PHEs."
All the levels will in turn provide supply chain information back to Issues to consider during the response 1.
"The LSC will coordinate, monitor, and track MCM flow from the central level warehouses and the prepositioning centers from action sites is provided for further planning."
"Specifically, the LSC will develop operational procedures to manage MCMs during preparedness and response as well as establish a dedicated information system that will facilitate the functionality of MCM supply chain activities, such as routine stock management, order filling, and consumption requesting organizations on their request 2."
Stockpiling and Prepositioning Stockpiling is a mechanism of managing MCMs for purposes of continuous preparedness for PHE to enable quick response.
The list of MCMs to be stockpiled will be determined and updated basing on the following criteria: The list of supplies currently considered for MDAs stockpiling is in Appendix IV The stockpiled MCMs shall be prepositioned and managed separately from regular supplies i.
"National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies MDAs and their partners may use a mix of prepositioning strategies including: no prepositioning at all, advance deployment, and caching/hoarding at user facilities."
"These should be stored separately Unless otherwise directed, these warehouses will apply expedited approval and dispatch processes for the MCMs as specified by the PHE processes."
"For regular PH operations, they should use their normal warehouse operations systems, and procedures to execute their routine activities in parallel to the emergency 1.4.2.3.3."
The respective sites will develop a requisition of MCMs required through the DTF.
"Number of symptomatic patients at c. Number of persons reporting to d. Shipping priority, taking into account critical needs, distance, and time to dispensing sites and the number and the type of transportation available Projected number of animals affected, dead, or exposed in case of a zoonotic disease f. Projected geographical area affected by The LSC will coordinate with the regional offices to ensure MCM deliveries to The LSC will develop, operationalize support the management of MCM supply 1.4.2.3.5."
"As a contingency measure, MDA procurement units will coordinate with the NTF and the DTF to obtain alternative transportation, if primary transportation means are not sufficient and 4."
The distributors and recipients of MCM personal protection and code of conduct while serving during a PHE and will follow normal receiving and reporting procedures plus any modifications as outlined in the guidelines for managing MCMs for PHEs in the different line Part of recovery is managing the MCM supply chain operations to the point where routine logistics can meet emergency supply needs.
Generate a demobilization plan: The NTF in collaboration with stakeholders will develop a 3.
MDAs in collaboration with the OPM are responsible for official media communications and for approving any public health messages concerning the response or overall situation.
"Responsible point persons in the  relevant MDAs and partners that contribute MCM supplies will be able to access the status of the supplies they  have donated or provided as well as status on total available stocks across the country at any time before, during, and after an emergency has occurred."
Tactical Communication Tactical communication is required among all response staff at all jurisdictional and logistics levels to control MCM supply chain operations 1.
Each MDA implicated in One Health response must have an emergency quick access fund for timely response to PHEs.
"The National One Health Platform stakeholders, through the NTF, will oversee five-year review of this document to ensure that the MCM supply chain plan is current and reflects the Lessons learned from previous response experiences (both exercises and actual Accomplishments and successes of the Research and development in PHEs Responses to PHEs in the last year Strategic plans for new activities."
National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies A well-performing health workforce is critical in the response to any PHE.
"This proportion of health personnel is bound to change as the country moves through the four stages of response  to the PHE, from the preparedness phase to the 2.1."
H has divided the subcommittees into pillars.
"Thus, the reader is encouraged to refer to the latest organogram from the Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC)."
"Composition of the health personnel deployed in the treatment The health personnel deployed during PHEs in the treatment unit will be assigned in each of the three shifts, and they will include Four Infection control and prevention officer (can be nurses or One personnel for psychosocial support Depending on the magnitude of the response, the health personnel listed above are adequate to respond to a severe outbreak of PHE in one treatment unit."
The assumption is that each PHEs.
The Human Resource will support the recruitment process for both government staff and seconded staff from partners who wish to have their recruitment process managed by the Taskforce.
"In such scenario, the responsible pillar is expected to submit a request for the technical support through the NTF to the office of the DIrector General Health Services (DGHS)."
"The request must highlight the roles and responsibilies of the health expert and where necessary, the terms and condition of The respective pillar is expected to work with the Human resource and procurement the DGHS will make an official request to the development partner supporting the recruitment process will be conducted by the NTF and the chair of NTF will make official request to the development partner for recruitment of Public Health experts."
PS and health personnel to be deployed must have an official release letter duly signed by the accounting officer.
"For health personnel working in the private sector, they will seek approval from their employers and may get formal recommendation from the MOH."
"For individuals seeking to provide technical support to other countries, the Health or District Local Government may provide a recommendation letter where 2.1.6."
"The NTF and the DTF, in collaboration with the respective performance, contracts and the activities that the health personnel deployed are supposed The MDAs, through the NTF, will continue to perform their roles, including planning, resource mobilization, budgeting, technical"
"Before that, the of Health, the Districts Local Government and the different development partners must ensure that all staff are fully facilitated before 2.1.9."
Operational cost and assumptions for deployment of Health personnel deployed during public health emergencies are entitled to facilitation for Public Services.
The period is determined basing on the average number of months spent in the last five years to respond or preparings for PHE (excluding COVID-19 All deployed staff will work for eight hours The risk payable will be graded as high (in direct contact with the cases or samples) medium (technical staff who are handling matters of response but not directly in touch with the cases and samples) and low (Ad- ministration).
The high risk currently is paid /= (eighty thousand shillings) irrespective of the qualification The facilitation for the risk allowance will be specified Facilitation for field activities during All staff who will be assigned to work 40km away from their work station will be entitled to perdiem as prescribed by the Public Services or otherwise specified All staff who are assigned to work at a place less than 40km from their workstation will receive safari day allowance as prescribed by

They are staff under MAAIF and supported by development partners like Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) amongst others.
"However, if such a need arises, the Permanent Secretary (PS) - MAAIF will request such support approved, additional human resources  can be recruited as per the terms and conditions highlighted in the request from the PS MAAIF and through the Public Service Commission or the District Service Commission."
"An adequate response to patients during PHEs requires a system that responds to three  levels, including response at the scene where the suspected PHE patient is taken care of during transportation in standard purposed ambulances, and standard care at the health facility level."
The country currently has 14 of these centres 2.
"The current national target is ambulances, of which 430 will be type Band thirty  type C 3."
"How to coordinate patients During the preparedness and response stage of any  PHE, the trained first responders can initiate the  process of patients or suspects transfer to the nearest facility for professional assessment and decision-making."
The first responders can initiate the ambulance vehicle response through a call and dispatch system.
The ambulance vehicle can also be activated by the attending health worker for intrafacility or inter-facility transfers.
This transfer process must follow the SOP and guidelines as highlighted by the case management team depending on the type of PHE Trained professional staff are required in the ambulances and at the emergency units at the health facility.
The national target for EMS staff who are required in case of a national epidemic response stands at one thousand twenty five .
"One type Bambulance is staffed with an ambulance driver and an emergency medical technician, while type Cis staffed with an ambulance driver, an emergency medical technician and a medical officer."
The regional call and dispatch centres are coordinated by EMS medical officers.
"At the moment, the country has 120 ambulance vehicles that meet the national norms and standards, giving a gap of 340 ambulances."
"Categories of different Type Bambulances are equipped with basic medical equipment to support life, including oxygen delivery equipment of up to 10 litres."
"Type Cambulances are equipped with advanced life support equipment, including manual defibrillators, monitors, and transport deliver over 20 litres of oxygen per minute."
The ambulances may be modified or manufactured to minimize the cross transfer of infection for the highly infectious disease pathogens.
Type D (Advanced life support ambulance or Isolation Transport Ambulance) have a Negative Pressure capsule or a Negative Pressure Patient Cabin designed to  minimize the  cross  transfer  of infection for the highly infectious disease pathogens.
"The ambulances are used to respond to biological, chemical,"
"H / Disaster response/ Highway Air Ambulance ( Albert, Central, West, North and East) and radiological threats that  have increased risks to first responders attending to or transporting patients that might carry these contagious ailments."
"The patient is placed on a stretcher and loaded in a specially designed sealed chamber, which is integrated inside an ambulance."
The negative pressure cabins are equipped with an air purification system consisting of UV light and HEPA filters.
These are unique transport services which are delivered this with the  support of other MDAs.
Organization structure and composition of EMS at national and EMS is a sub-pillar under the case management Pillar.
"It has a national command structure, regional command structure and district 1."
"Ambulance vehicle teams - @3 The Electronic Emergency Medical Services (EEMS) system is under development, and"
"National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies during public health emergencies, there is a need to mobilize the EMS team based on estimated needs at each point in time."
The Emergency Healthcare Professionals  scheme of service has been developed to guide in recruitment and deployment of staff.
Emergency care protocols and guidelines are required for professional patient transfer and 3.2.1.
Samples from suspected and probable cases can be submitted to the district or regional laboratory.
Referrals of samples to the National Animal Diseases Diagnostics and Epidemiological Center (NADDEC) may be if there is no testing capacity at the district and regional veterinary laboratories.
"This should follow the existing SOPs for animal sample collection, sample packaging, sample transportation and lab sample analysis for the Activate the operationalization of animal compartments for suspected cases, probable cases and confirmed cases."
Ensure that there is strict case follow-up during treatment regimen and observation of Safe disposal of carcasses of dead animals disposing of carcasses from dead animals during a public health emergency.
Carcasses can be disposed of safely by deep burying in the ground or incineration.
Destruction of animal carcasses operationalize and disseminate guidelines for safe disposal of carcasses that have died from a PHE with guidance from MAAIF.
"Vaccination of the health herd In most outbreak emergencies, risk-based vaccination is always considered."
Requesting and receipt of transport services at national and The head of transport at the national and district level is responsible for the management of transport services during PHEs.
"Further, the officer must ensure that the drivers have a valid driving license and are competent to drive the allocated vehicle."
The transport officer in charge will also ensure that all the vehicles used during PHEs are fully insured against any foreseeable risks.
"Through the chairperson of the National Taskforce, a request for transport services is placed by the respective subcommittee to the transport officer."
These will be taken back to the URA Registry of Motor Vehicles  before the vehicles are handed over to the responsible MDA.
The sectors shall develop key indicators to monitor progress.
The different sectors may agree on common indicators to monitor progress with the implementation of the National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies.
An evaluation of the activities should be done at the end of the response during the After-Action Review (AAR) meeting and the report is shared.
"The task force can also monitor and evaluate the interventions to check its effectiveness e.g., MCMs handling and storage, supply chain management, human resources deployment, and transportation services."
Other aspects to monitor include access and availability of services during a PHE and development of action plans for use to improve future responses to PHEs.
This can be done using tools that are developed by different sectors during the response.

"Structural Interoperability: the uniform movement of healthcare data from one system to achieve structural interoperability, the receiving system should be able to interpret information at the data field level."
This is the intermediate level of interoperability.
Semantic Interoperability: the ability of health IT systems to exchange and interpret information and then actively use information that has been exchanged.
This is the highest level of interoperability.
"Digital Health: refers to the use of information and communications technologies in health Client Registry: is a directory that lists all clients and their relevant personal information (names, addresses, etc.)."
A client registry is designed to assist in uniquely identifying individuals who receive health care services by supporting the centralised storage and retrieval of the client (i.e.
Electronic Health Facility Registry: this is an application that allows users to access the list of all health facilities in the country (Master Facility List (MFL)).
Health Worker Registry: this is an application that allows authorised stakeholders to access the list of health workers within the various health facilities and the community in the country based on agreed-upon standards.
It comprises a minimum dataset on all providers of healthcare services that can be shared with all systems that need them.
"Shared Health Record:  It is an operational transactional subset of normalised data for a patient from various systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) etcetera."
This record is queried and updated between the different institutions and systems that are authorised to do so.
"Information Model: is a representation of concepts, tools, data flows and the relationships, constraints rules, and operations to specify how systems or data sources are linked."
OSI Model: This is a conceptual framework used to represent how applications communicate
This is evidenced by the inclusion of digital health as one of the priorities in the enabler for supporting better healthcare service delivery.
Health information systems have proved valuable in supporting patient care and improving population health outcomes by making data readily available for decision-making at all levels of the health sector.
"However, these health information systems are typically isolated within organisations."
"Ultimately, this fragmentation may prevent timely access to necessary information leading to duplication and delayed decision making hence the need for standardised and interoperable health information exchange (HIE)."
HIE is the secure electronic transfer of health information among healthcare organisations using nationally recognised communication protocols and safety standards.
"Therefore, there is a need to standardise HIE bearing in mind the known limitations and preconditions as well as provide guidance on best-known practices."
"These are used to address a access clients information generated by different HIS and the possibility of progressively enriching the data at different locations whenever the clients interact with health systems across The goal of HIE is to facilitate the secure and seamless exchange of patient health information in a standardised format, ensuring that relevant and timely data is available."
It is against this background that the Information Exchange and Interoperability.
"Most of these solutions are limited in scale, likely to be proprietary and operate in isolation."
Lack of interoperability has been recognized as a critical obstacle to realising the potential benefits of digital health in the country.
"There have been ad-hoc attempts to implement HIE use cases within the sector, such as data exchange within some aggregate reporting systems, EMRs exchanging data with the national Viral Load Information System, and surveillance m. Trac system exchanging data with the"
"However, all these were not premised on nationally endorsed HIE and Interoperability guidelines."
H as a custodian of the healthcare system in the country has embarked on developing its national HIE and Interoperability guidelines to ensure that health data collected is capable of being shared and facilitate primary and secondary uses of patient health information (i.e.
"It is also important that for any two or more heterogeneous systems to exchange data meaningfully, there must be a mutual standard for data exchange or communication between those systems."
Health information exchange standards provide clear guidelines for robust and Therefore Mo.
"Feedback from the various stakeholders was incorporated into the document during the development, validation and approval process."
The guidelines were then presented to the HIIRE TWG and the Senior Management Committee for endorsement and then to the Top Management Committee for approval.
"Whilst the health sector may use a combination of both paper-based and digital exchange solutions for interactions, this document focuses on electronic data, digital data exchange, and protocols to assist the Mo."
The document is intended for: Policymakers at all levels.
"Specifically, common global goods have been recognized across public and private entities as a fundamental course of action towards building interoperable, cost-effective, easy-to-use infrastructure components."
Each solution should support incremental extension into a fully integrated national health information system without substantial reengineering.
It is not practical to either discard the existing systems or have only one system in place to solve the interoperability problem given that we have many siloed or fragmented systems.
H encourages the use and application of newer and more modern technologies that have proven real-world application to maximise long-term benefits.
Below are the messaging standards that shall be adopted.

"This section highlights the basic tenets of sustainability: capacity building; ensuring user and stakeholder contributions are not minimised due to interruptions such as loss of funding; and creating solutions more likely to be embedded into policies, daily practices, and workflows."
"H is encouraged to critically evaluate and address the following; Procurement framework as per the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act 2003, and the NITAU Procurement of ICT Goods and Product Guidelines that"
Implementing a fully functional HIE infrastructure and ecosystem is no mean feat and requires the presence and interplay of several fundamental components.
"Indeed, investment in HIE should be considered within the wider digital health ecosystem."
Timeliness within all regions was below the 80% target.

"High priority signals being monitored are: readiness of MVD importation from Rwanda, presumptive yellow fever cases in eight districts, cluster of deaths in Mubende, suspected cholera in Koboko, undiagnosed illness from DRC, cholera in DRC, Tanzania and South Sudan, c. VDPV2 in Kenya and DRC."
"This success can be attributed to several key factors: the outstanding community mobilization efforts led by Local Council Chairpersons (LC1s) and Village Health Teams (VHTs), the unwavering commitment of frontline health workers, the positive response from communities, and the crucial financial and technical support provided by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) and other partners."
"Finally, Icommend parents and caregivers for their active participation and for ensuring no child was left behind in this critical endeavor."
"With the threat of wild poliovirus (WPV) on the continent and confirmed c. VDPV2 outbreaks in neighboring countries, it is imperative to continue enhancing routine immunization systems to safeguard against virus importations."
"Coordination and monitoring were overseen by the National Coordination Committee (NCC), with active involvement of all immunization partners."
Surveillance efforts were enhanced during the campaign.
"District Health Teams (DHTs) and Village Health Teams (VHTs) were oriented on Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance, and data were captured in real-time using the Epi-Vac online dashboard."
"In Round 1, 110 suspected AFP cases were reported, with 35 cases in Round 2."
"After verification, only confirmed cases were retained, and all were investigated, with results showing many had been previously reported."
"Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) were minimal, with 28 cases in Round 1 and six in Round 2, all found to be nonsignificant."
"After each round, after-action review meetings were conducted, and feedback from all regions informed the development of a surveillance improvement plan to strengthen AFP detection post-campaign."
"It is bordered by Kenya to the East, Democratic Republic of Congo to the West, South Sudan to the North, United Republic of Tanzania to the South and Rwanda in the South west."
"Rural areas of districts are subdivided into sub-counties,  parishes, and  villages."
Municipal and town councils are designated in urban areas of districts.
"A patient's first point of contact within the health system is often through the Village Health Team (VHT), who are responsible for basic health interventions within local communities and villages."
All immunization activities are coordinated by UNEPI.
This was responded to with 2 round campaigns conducted in January & .
"Detection of Circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus Type 2 (VDPV2) On 07 , c. VDPV2 was isolated from the environmental surveillance site located in Doko in Mbale city."
Health was notified by the Lab on 27 .
There was an IHR notification on 30 and the outbreak was declared by the DGHS on 01 .
The neighboring countries of South Sudan and Kenya are also responding to outbreaks of c. VDPV2.
There are internally displaced persons from Karamoja in the industrial division of the city at Namatala cell.
"This area is also referred to as Karamoja, given the high numbers The city boasts diverse industries, including the Industrial Park, which contributes to its economic vitality."
"The predominant ethnic group in Mbale city and district is the Bagisu ethnic group, renowned for their cultural practices, including the Imbalu ceremony."
"Most people visiting the Mbale bus and taxi parks are in transit to other areas to and from neighboring districts in Mbale and other regions or to countries such as Kenya, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda."
There are religious sects in the city such as Injiri/666 that preach against routine vaccination interventions.
"Meanwhile, Somali refugees engage in business ventures or pursue quarters/Amber courts which is one of the communities served by Doko Sewage Plant."
"A total of 29 cases were documented, comprising 24 suspected, 1 probable, and confirmed cases."
"Recommendations were forwarded to the industrial park administration, urging the establishment of proper sewage treatment facilities and the appointment of an environmental health officer to oversee sanitation practices."
"However, adherence to these recommendations by the park administration has been lacking, despite the existence of a Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) plan."
"In Mbale district, 24 cases were identified, including 5 confirmed and 19 suspected cases, mainly from Bumasule and Malema villages."
The confirmed cases were linked to zero dose vaccination against measles and residing in households affiliated with a religious group opposing routine vaccination.
"Instead, targeted vaccination initiatives were implemented in outbreak hotspots and underperforming health facilities."
"Meanwhile, Manafwa district, situated adjacent to Mbale district's eastern border, declared a measles outbreak on , 2024, after 4 of 6 samples collected from suspected children in Bugobero HCIV and analyzed at the UVRI were positive for the disease."
"Overall, a total of 62 cases (4 confirmed and 58 epidemiologically linked) were identified and these were from Bumateyo village."
Kibuku district in the low zone continuously has a high Malaria incidence.
"Complications of Malaria such as blackwater fever and anemia have led to a high mortality and morbidity in Kibuku Multi-hazard risk assessments have identified several districts in the Mbale region, including Mbale city and district, as high-risk areas for flooding."
The district developed a measles response plan but was not able to conduct mass vaccination for children under 5 years.
The Mbale region has 3 main zones by virtue of its location around mountain Elgon.
The highland zone is prone to disasters following heavy rainfall which lead to mass wasting of soils and landslides.
"The mid- highland zone is also at risk of falling debris, boulders, landslides, mass wasting, hailstorms, and flooding, while the low-lying zone experiences flooding which is widespread, hailstorms, siltation, and prolonged dry spells."
"Subsequently, landslides have been reported in Bulambuli district, further exacerbating the challenges faced by the region Active AFP search in Health facilities and communities in Mbale city and district health facilities were mapped in Mbale city."
"Overall, 1 AFP late case was identified at Mbale regional referral were collected for assessment."
The visited health facilities along the blue line included have data collection tools or job aids.
There was no documented case of AFP on active case search in the health facilities along the blue line.
"Regarding IPV1 coverage, 17 districts were below 80% in 2022, but this number significantly improved to four districts in 2023 and further to two districts in Tororo district has consistently had both IPV1 and OPV3 coverage below 50% for both and 2023."
"Stool adequacy was consistently low, and AFP zero dose cases showed a decrease from 17.6% in 2022 to 11.7% in 2024."
"NPENT cases saw an increase, and stool adequacy was slightly better in 2024 at 22%."
"In Jinja, covering 12 districts, silent districts were highest at 91.7% in 2023 but dropped to 16.7% in 2024."
"NPAFP rates varied, and NPENT cases were highest at 100% in 2024."
Continued efforts are needed to address these gaps and enhance immunization coverage.
Rapid Risk assessment was conducted and submitted to Rapid Response Team (RRT).
Three  scenarios were recommended and presented for consideration by the RRT/OBRG.
"One was to do a nation-wide campaign, the second to do a Sub national campaign covering the regions of Mbale, Karamoja, Jinja, Kampala Metropolitan Area and all Border districts with Kenya, DRC and South Sudan covering 67 districts and the third one was to conduct a sub national campaign covering the region of Mbale and its neighboring three  regions along the Kenya border of Soroti, Jinja, and Karamoja covering 49 districts."
Final records indicated an administrative coverage of 3.269 million children (118%) and 3.5million children (127%) aged between 0 to 4.9 years for Round 1 & 2 respectively were vaccinated against Polio with the n. OPV2 Vaccine.
"Campaign Strategy and Geographical Scope of the Outbreak The Polio Outbreak Response was a two round sub national n. OPV2 supplemental immunization campaign (SIA) house to house campaign targeting children under 5 years of age estimated at  in the 49 districts and four regions of Mbale, Jinja, Teams were allocated by population with each team expected to vaccinate at least 125 and 250 children per day in rural and urban settings respectively."
Provision of means of transportation for special team and hard to reach areas including islands was arranged.
The duration of the campaign was 4 days per round with Round 1 starting on Thursday 3rd October to Sunday 6th of October and Round 2 starting on Thursday 7th th .
"The campaign target was to achieve a 95% coverage Geographical scope of the Outbreak Response The 49 districts are strategically spread across the four  key regions, covering areas with historically low routine immunization coverage and evidence of poliovirus circulation."
A significant number of these districts are located in border areas where cross-border movements with neighboring Kenya amplify the risk of virus transmission.
"Urban districts face challenges of high population density, while rural districts are marked by geographical inaccessibility and weaker health infrastructure."
"Visual maps have been used to highlight the geographic distribution, ensuring focused and tailored interventions across all regions."
"The districts of Namayingo, Mayuge and Jinja are located along Lake Victoria and have islands with populations to be reached."
"Demographic details and Vaccine requirements by region The total population across the 49 districts is estimated at , with approximately  children under five years of age  the primary target group for immunization during this campaign."
Special attention was given to identifying and immunizing these populations to mitigate risks.
"Communities in hard-to-reach, underserved, or conflict-affected areas; Cross-Border Movement: We have Ten  districts with significant cross-border movements that may contribute to virus importation or spread and they include; Kaabong, Moroto, Amudat, Bukwo, Kween, Namisindwa, Tororo, Busia, Namayingo 5."
"Preparations for the SIAs 5.1   Resource Mobilization and Financing Resource mobilization and financial planning were critical to the campaigns success, with efforts focused on securing funding, allocating resources effectively, and addressing any budgetary shortfalls."
"Financial Support Received and Allocated: The campaign benefited from financial contributions from the GPEI Team, and funds were channeled through the main GPEI Partners, WHO, and UNICEF, as summarized below."
Approved Summary Budget for Round 1 Round 1 included a component for capacity building of Teams at all levels that were going to implement the campaign.
"Nonetheless, the biggest proportion of the funds was meant to cover Human resources (31%) and Transportation (32%) for supervisors Approved Summary Budget for Round 2 Round 2 excluded a component for capacity building of Teams since this was covered during Round 1."
The majority of the funds were still allocated towards Human resources (35%) and Transportation (39%) for supervisors and vaccination teams.
Allocations for District level activities The bulk of the funds at District level were allocated towards community awareness activities to build trust in the community and uptake for the campaign.
District level social mobilization was allocated 29% in Round 1 and 36% in Round 2.
The second area allocated more funds was actual implementation by the Teams composed of the Health workers and recorders.
"Implementation was allocated 16% in Round 1 and 22% District level Activities 1.1 District coordination meetings 1.2 Micro Planning and training ,.3 Sub County Microplanning &Training ,.1 District Level Social Mobilization 3.1 DHT Monitoring of preparedness 4.2 Cold Chain Maintenance 4.3 Delivery of Vaccines and Icepacks 6.1 Implementation District Supervisors 6.2 Implementation SC Supervisors 6.3 Implementation Team Supervisors 7."

"For health workers, supervisors, mobilizers, and recorder allowances, ODK registration was undertaken during the training exercise to capture all the details of the participants, including their phone numbers and mobile money numbers."
Payments were made directly to the relevant participants mobile money phone numbers.
This ensured that all risks of none and delayed payments were addressed.
"The NCC is comprised of five subcommittees: resource mobilization, training & micro planning, advocacy communication & social mobilization, logistics & vaccine management, and data & surveillance subcommittees."
"Members of the NCC were from over 35 organizations, including the UNEPI, and all immunization partners, including WHO, UNICEF, CDC, USAID, Rotary, PATH, CHAI, and NMS."
A total of four NCC meetings were convened from .
"UNEPI teams were provided monthly, bi-weekly, and weekly updates from the districts using a WHOAFRO-developed standard spreadsheet template provided for documentation."
"In addition, with support from the GPEI Coordinator, weekly country GPEI meetings were held to review the status of preparedness to identify challenges and mitigation measures."
The country also participated in the weekly GPEI-AFRO virtual meetings where she was advised on Campaign preparation.
The country was advised on how to address and put in place mitigation measures for The graphs below show the preparedness level prior to implementation
"Detailed assessments were carried out to map target populations, including vulnerable groups such as children under five, underserved communities, and populations in hard-to-reach Regional EOCs conducted readiness assessment of districts to review the status of preparedness of districts and developed mitigation measures."
"Two of the meetings were held before the campaign for sensitization and planning purposes; one meeting was held intra-campaign to review progress and plan for the following campaign days and the last meetings was held after the campaign to evaluate the success, challenges and share the results of the campaign."
Rotary Clubs were involved in conducting community dialogues to increase awareness and service acceptability before the campaign.
"Based on UBOS projections from 2014 census, the under-five population for the target area was estimated to be 2.7million children."
The National Coordination Committees and the EOC were activated.
This plan was reviewed by the national-level coordination platforms of partners through the National Coordination Committee and its respective subcommittees.
"After consultation with Partners, the target population was estimated at ."
The microplanning template was developed by the logistics and cold chain subcommittee and revised by WHO.
The District microplanning template was reviewed and approved by the NCC subcommittees prior to distribution.
"At the national level, the district micro plans were reviewed to check for consistency in the estimation of target populations and adherence to guidelines and collated in a database by region 6.2 District level planning Planning at District level was supported by the relevant Regional EOCs."
"These were supplemented with 3 SBC consultants, 2 National VAMS, 49 Central supervisors and National level VAMs deployed to support each district among other resources deployed by UNICEF and WHO."
"The micro-plans included verifying the target population, number of villages, parishes, sub counties, verification of the cold chain inventory, development of logistics distribution plans, social mobilization plan including plan to cover high risk populations and hard to The filled-out plans were submitted to the Regional and National EOCs for review and compilation at the central-level."
Each sub-committee was tasked to review and update their respective technical sections of the content within the field guide.
"This was in areas of: social mobilization, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, cold chain and logistics management."
"The SIAs field guide used in the previous SIAs was reviewed in the depth and updated to include updated technical information from WHO and contextualize them with the 7.2 Central-level training As part of the preparation process for both rounds, Mo."
"H, with support from partners, conducted the National training to equip supervisors with knowledge about the campaign approach; this was a one-day training held on the 24th of Objectives of the training To ensure high quality campaign implementation at district level vaccinate at least 95% (by LQAS) of under 5 children in the 49 implementing districts."
"Strengthen routine immunization, second year of life platform, and enhance Training Schedules and Focus Areas: Training sessions were conducted two weeks prior to the campaign, with a strong focus on technical and operational preparedness."
These individuals were responsible for cascading training to district and subcounty levels.
"From RRHs, Partners, NSTOP, Fellows; flagged off training and topics covered Special Focus on High-Risk Areas: Additional emphasis was placed on training teams working in high-risk areas, including hard-to-reach districts, insecure areas, and regions with low vaccination coverage."
"The trainers also elaborated in detail the concepts of quality campaigns, why the campaign is relevant, teaming and supervision of field teams, guidelines for budgeting and financial management, microplanning, and data management."
"Power point presentations were projected for all to see, and printed task-oriented guide for health workers and polio frequently asked questions were provided to participants and used as visual aids in this training."
The training was officially flagged off by the Director Public Health who also monitored the exercise.
He mentioned that we need to enhance awareness so that masses can know why the intervention is necessary.
"He encouraged people to put to use the resources that have been provided to combat polio, highlighting the low coverage of routine immunization for IPV which is below The Director recommended that travel screening and vaccination be heightened especially for people travelling."
"The training covered the following topics: Introduction of polio outbreaks response plan and immunization and Polio House to House strategy of polio immunization campaign Budget & Financial management guidelines and payment terms Micro planning for polio immunization campaign Training and team selection Facts on Novel Oral Polio Vaccine Advocacy, communication and social mobilization for polio immunization Supervision, data management & accountability ODK Supervision Tools and Registration tools for payment A pre and posttest was administered to all participants."
The pretest score ranged from 52-100% and the average for the group was 74%.
In the post test a range score between 61-100% and the average for the group was 87%.
For those facilitators who did not achieve the set posttest score of 80% additional orientation was given so that they could understand better and do the same in the district trainings.
"District-level training was attended by District Health Teams (DHT), Sub-county supervisors, and Partners."
"It was a one-day held between 30th September  2nd , depending on the District plans."
The trainings were well facilitated with meals and participant allowances.
"Following the District level training, Vaccination teams were trained at the sub-county level, facilitated by the Sub-county supervisors."
"A total of 933 sub-county supervisors, parish supervisors, and a total of  VHT were targeted."
"The Sub-county level trainings were facilitated using one of the IEC materials: the task-oriented field guide, which focuses on the development of daily team implementation plans."
There was adequate time for mobilization for sub county trainings and this enabled full attendance of targeted participants.
"The objective of the training was to; Sensitize leaders, health workers and stakeholders about the upcoming Plan and prepare the districts, sub-county levels, vaccination teams and the Strengthen routine immunization The training was facilitated by assigned district supervisors, with support from a Topics discussed during the training were; The importance of immunization Data recording and management How to deal with resistant parents /Care takers Sam Ofori making presentation on RND1 results Christine making her submission"
"Each district was allocated one National VAM, making it a total of 49 VAMs from the central level."
"The trainings were held on 27th September and 2nd  for both Round and 2, respectively, at Fairway Hotel Kampala."
The Team was taken through the Vaccine Accountability Standard Operating Procedures and tools.
"Session4; Cold chain and vaccine management for n. OPV2 campaign, CCE inventory (vaccine carriers, icepacks, estimation of vaccines and supplies, Icepack freezing The logistics preparations that covered the CCE inventory review for vaccine and associated transportation and storage, the estimation and distribution was discussed."
"Session5; Vaccine accountability monitoring tools The participants were taken through the vaccine accountability framework and the tools/ forms that are used for recording and monitoring the vaccine distribution, utilization and reporting."
The SOPs for vials verification and documentation including writing and submitting of incident reports in case of missing vials was discussed.
"Session8; Recording of field activities using ODK As part of the monitoring and reporting, the participants were taken through the ODK, the fact that vaccine accountability forms are now available in the system."
"Session9; TOR, Teaming and Administrative briefing The participants were introduced the TOR for VAMs and HWs managing n. OPV2 vials Preparatory meeting for RND202nd Performance of polio OBR RND1(results as by dashboard) Vaccine accountability monitoring Sample District presentation Overview of Vaccine accountability monitoring National level RND1 Overview of Vaccine accountability monitoring tools Plans for RND2 (vaccine distribution, district budgets) Follow up UNICEF funded activities (registration and endorsement including the VHTs and LC1s, accountability) TOR, Teaming, Fuel cards (transport arrangements) Performance of RND1 as by ODK Dashboard A summary of the administrative coverage as by the Dashboard was presented by Dr. Fabrizio indication that the national coverage was 118% which a contribution of the key players."
"However, he noted that the vaccine accountability reporting (vials used) using ODK was not same as what was coming from the Form A reports and stressed the need for the DVAMs to ensure they reconcile information with the district Biostats."
"For reported shortage of Forms, more had been printed and participants were to pick Sub National level VAM training VAMs at sub national level were trained by the National Supervisors and National VAMs with the Health Vaccination Teams to ensure a harmonized implementation and accountability."
"Emphasis was on filling to the VAM forms and the need to ensure all vials (usable, unusable or broken) are returned by the HWs."
"Acting on this notification, while no human polio cases have been confirmed, a response was started by of vaccine hesitancy and low vaccination coverage thanks to largely behavioral and social determinants as well as intervention design and implementation gaps drivers, the results of a Polio assessment conducted showed that out of the 113 children under years assessed, only 20% had vaccination cards as evidence of vaccination (MOH It is against this background that an anthropologist was commissioned to conduct a qualitative behavioral and social determinates study and spearhead behavioral modeling of hesitant populations as WHOs technical support into the ongoing Polio and Measles outbreak response in the region."
"Methodology and exploratory study design with a participant observation (action research) approach was utilized in this intervention from th to 16th 2024 in Mbale city, Mbale, Manafwa, Butebo and Kibuku districts using six key methods."
Perceptions on the outbreak: There are two divergent perceptions: Trainings in some sub-counties lacked practical's sessions hence poor vaccination skills Incomplete Teaming and participation Late start of training activities Key Issues Under Training
Children that are not vaccinated are the reason we have VPDs in circulation 4/10 think vaccination is not necessary.
These believe: The cases of measles suspected in the area are just of a simple rush that will disappear or symptoms of gonorrhea that can be treated with herbs ii.
Vaccination is against their religious belief that allows for only traditional iii.
Its their human right not to be forced to vaccinate v.	 Parents must consent before their children are vaccinated in school vi.
No one is liable if a child develops after effects from non-safe vaccines 2.
"Beliefs and Practices with Potential to Drive the transmission risk of VPDs and The potential for the transmission risk of VPDs like the c. VDP is driven by six key beliefs and practices observed, including: ii."
This belief can facilitate the spread diseases transmitted through the fecal oral route such as Polio iii.
Poor disposal of pharmaceutical waste at HC 2 and HC3 where a proper collection system is lacking iv.
Factors Affecting Vaccination Coverage Performance: The vaccination coverage performance in the region was found poor.
Design and Implementation Gaps: The assessment mapped out design and implementation gaps that have contributed to the poor EPI performance in the region under four areas.
"Vaccine hesitancy: Given the vaccine hesitancy, there are attacks on vaccinators and hostilities towards VHTs ii."
Drivers of hesitancy against Vaccination: Five categories of factors were mapped as the key drivers of hesitancy in the Elgon and Bukedi regions: Low awareness levels and non-targeted engagements with stakeholders ii.
Some of these include the perception that (i) Africans are being vaccinated to give them terminal illnesses because white people (Bill Gates) wants to reduce their population (ii) vaccines harm/kill children instead of safeguarding them (iii) its no ones liability if a child is harmed by a vaccine (iv) vaccines for routine immunization are not in the health facilities (v) Its vaccines that caused the current AFP cases (vi) a school will only vaccinate a child if a parent has consented to it in writing iv.
Religious beliefs (Njiri 666 cult religious beliefs): Two extreme religious beliefs were mapped from the Njiri 666 cult group: (i) Child vaccination is setting pace for Satanic new world order (ii) Everything forced on people has evil v.	 Social media and misinformation: All the beliefs and misperceptions above are awash in the social media and creating infodemics.
The recommendations generated are presented using a pillar-based approach.
It is also heat sensitive.
Residue should be disposed professionally.
VHTs should mobilize.
"Polio radio and TV spots, as well as DJ mentions, were aired until 10th th November for the second round of polio campaign."
Translation of the IEC materials was done by HPE&Cin 11 local languages catering for the languages spoken in the 49 districts.
The use of local languages was aimed at mitigating language barriers in different communities.
Materials were distributed to the lower facilities in time and were visibly seen in communities.
"Messaging on social media immensely helped in amplifying awareness and publicity of the campaign among the users, as was evident from the social listening reports for the period between  that included the campaign days."
"PAS-mounted trucks were used in all the districts to reach communities with key messages on the house-to-house Polio campaign in the sub counties, busy town centers, cities, municipalities and markets."
"These community drives were majorly supported by DHEs, Health Educators, Health Assistants and VHTs."
H (HPE&Cand UNEPI) with support of UNICEF conducted the following Advocacy meetings were conducted at district level both physically and virtually with different stakeholders who were expected to cascade the dissemination of polio messages to the lower levels in each district.
It was anticipated that stakeholders selected and oriented at district level would have more impact in terms of enhancing community engagement initiatives on polio campaign than targeting the stakeholders Advocacy.
It was facilitated by the national level Public Relations office of the Mo.
Each district conducted orientation meeting with the FBOs and cultural leaders with support of HPE&CACSM sub-committee with guidance from NCC decided to conduct this orientation meeting at district level because the stakeholders would have more impact at community level since they are closer to the communities through places of worship.
The focus was on major FBOs in each district that extensive networks with various religious institutions at community level which have been supporting the Go.
The meeting brought together representatives of the health professional councils from the 5 regions and were oriented virtually by HPEC and UNEPI.
"The participants were selected from the five regions of Busoga, Bugisu, Bukedi, Teso and Karamoja and were oriented virtually by HPEC and UNEPI staff."
"As per the data available from 49 districts in the implementing districts of the country, a total of 1712 religious leaders were engaged in 49 districts through advocacy meetings before the implementation of the campaign."
The House-to-House Sensitization through the trained VHTs/LC1s was another key activity under community engagement.
"To sensitize communities for the first round of the Polio campaign,  mobilisers (village health teams and LCs) were mobilized and deployed to educate the community on polio campaign."
VHTs were a key channel for message dissemination and raising awareness about the campaign to the community and households using the IPC method.
"In most districts, they also registered all eligible children up to the age of 5 years for easy tracking during implementation and followup in case the children were missed."
"These meetings facilitated dialogues on key immunization topics, including the Polio house-to-house campaign, between community leaders/members and the service providers to improve knowledge and awareness levels on Polio and the campaign in the community."
"In total, four preparatory meetings were organized, three of them were at the CHOs Office at Mbale city and one of them was held at the venue of the launch (Busamaga playground) in Mbale City."
Polio Immunization Launch was successfully held at Busamaga playground in Mbale City and the Director of Public Health-Mo.
"In attendance were Development Partners such as WHO Representative, UNICEF Representative, CDC Representative, CAO and RDCs from Mbale region districts."
The launch was also attended by the Kenya delegation from Mo.
"Furthermore, they were instrumental Launch of polio campaign-Bungoma-Kenya"
"ACSM activities at the district and sub-county levels were found to be satisfactory, with IEC distribution completed in all the districts."
"Social Media Monitoring/social listening UNICEF engaged IPSOS to provide social media monitoring/listening services to track trending public views on Polio and routine immunization in general on the internet and social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and news sites."
"By the end of , IPSOS had analyzed  posts and over 198 million audiences reached by potential impressions (number of times the content was viewed/ seen), with 82% positive conversations,18% Neutral and 2% negative sentiments around immunization, and Polio inclusive ."
"Positive engagements were mostly around the launch of The Big Catch Up campaign, polio immunization, and focusing on vaccine safety, effectiveness, and public health messaging related to various immunization programs."
Negative conversations were mostly noticed around vaccine-related content .
"In the week of 25th  preceding the campaign, the overall sentiments were positive at 56% compared to the previous week, with Negative sentiments remaining at 38%."
"It had two main objectives of mobilization which include: Boosting High-Performing Areas: In districts like Busia, Jinja, Kamuli, and Tororo, where coverage is already high, community mobilization was aimed at pushing towards near-universal coverage through polio campaign."
"The U-Reporters in the 10 districts were able to mobilize over  people for polio campaign and routine immunization in a ACSM activities at the District level included but were not limited to the following; Engagement with political and civic leaders on routine immunization and supplementary immunization campaigns Participation in media activities through radio talk shows Participation in mobilization of communities through announcements in churches Orientation of religious and cultural leaders, House hold registration and mobilization Conducting community dialogue sessions at sub-county and community level Special populations, Nomads, Islands, fishing communities , insecurity LCVs supervised LC3 chairpersons to hold sensitization meetings for the lower The RDCs conducted sensitization meetings in the district and the same time monitored implementation of polio campaign."
DHEs used mobile sound systems on pick-ups to disseminate messages on polio DHEs held sensitization meetings with LCs & VHTs in hard to reach/ serve areas and resistant communities  Islands DHEs conducted sensitization meetings with LCs & VHTs in hard to reach/ serve areas and resistant communities - other hard to reach areas The DHEs conduct 1 day orientation of VHTs and LCs and engaged them in 3 mobilization and registration of children under 5 years DEOs were oriented on polio campaign and given airtime to contact school authorities to mobilize school children for vaccination and preach out to parents to allow their children for vaccination.
This was made possible by early involvement of city stakeholders in the planning and coordination.
All national level activities were implemented with orientation of 34 DHEs out of 49 DHEs in the target districts.
Radio talk shows were successfully conducted on 8 radio stations selected from each of the 5 regions and messages were aired on 8 radio stations and 1 TV station.
Polio campaign IEC materials for round one were delivered in time to all the 49 districts by UNICEF and were timely distributed to the community.
"Overall, there was high level of awareness which was a collective effort of different sources of information as indicated in the graph below:"
"The District Health Educators, District Health Officers and the district leadership were all availed with updated information which they disseminated to the public School based initiatives were increased through engaging the District Education Officers who wrote letters to head teachers and school inspectors to mobilize schools and support the program."
"Key bottlenecks/challenges experienced during planning, preparation and The budget for film vans in each region was inadequate."
Each region was allocated a film van but was only able to cover a maximum of 4 districts in 5 days allocated for Inadequate funds to implement some activities like the orientation of Members of Parliament on polio campaign
The batteries supplied were not enough and could not last for more than a day of Pockets of religious sects and resistant communities were registered in all the districts and these affected demand for immunization services.
The period for campaign planning and implementation was short given the compacted number of activities that were to be implemented in a short time ACSM preparedness data was not visible on the national dashboard because DHEs did not work with the Biostatisticians to populate the dashboard.
RDCs and other district leaders are engaged during campaigns and no plans for engaging them during routine immunization.
"The involvement of RDCs, DISOs, GISOs and PISOs in mobilization for polio campaign, was key in reducing resistance against polio immunization campaign as some reasonable force was applied to get the children of resistant communities Engagement with DHEs in discussions about the ACSM budget during orientation prior to the campaign left no room for some districts to divert ACSM budget Some members of the community who did not see the vaccination teams in their areas after 2 days of the campaign, started making calls to DHOs and DHEs demanding for their children to be vaccinated."
This is a sign of high level of awareness and appreciation of polio campaign benefits that resulted into demand and acceptance of polio vaccination.
The engagement of influential and supportive religious and community leaders was commended as a good practice since during mobilization they helped to reach the resistant religious sects and communities and preached using the Bible.
Community engagement and trust building are essential for increased acceptance Mapping the locations of resistant communities/religious sects and following up on whether they take their children for routine immunization and complete the schedule is a sure way of ensuring that resistant communities do not only immunize their children under duress during campaigns but also during routine immunization.
This is one of the ways to reduce the burden of zero dose and underimmunized children in these communities.
"To mitigate this risk, strict vaccine management protocols need to be enforced, and the absence of n. OPV2 after the vaccination campaign must be validated, confirming that n. OPV2 is not left in the cold chain system."
"Notably, this process is informed by GPEI and the WHO guidance which stipulates that national public health officials and country response teams undertake the necessary steps required to validate n. OPV2 removal."
"Guided by the polio NTF the management, monitoring, removal, and disposal of n. OPV2 at all vaccine storage and use levels are critical and must be confirmed and validated by external monitors who check the documentation and processes of n. OPV2 strict As per GPEI protocols that calls for efficient and effective containment and safe disposal of n. OPV2 vials at the end of the OBR, it was recommended that countries engage vaccine accountability monitors to support the logistics management and ensure that all vials are accounted for at all levels."
The logistics pillar has a core mandate to ensure effective and efficient supply chain for vaccines and related supplies that deliver quality immunization supplies to the right places in the right quantities at the right time in line with effective vaccine management standards.
The pillar is responsible for planning and coordination on procurement and delivery of vaccines and logistics to affected areas including inventory and logistics management and support.
"With focus on polio type 2 containment/ safe disposal, the pillar is also responsible for retrieval, inactivation and proper disposal of all the vials at The group comprises a core committee of key immunization stakeholders, and other members that may not be permanent on the group."
"Included also was assessment of cold chain capacity, recruitment and training of vaccine accountability monitoring team, procurement and distribution of VAM tools, Zip lock bags where unusable vials would be placed, support districts for procurement of fuel for freezing of icepacks in district vaccine stores, cold chain equipment maintenance, transport facilitation for supervision and monitoring by the vaccine accountability monitors VAMs."
Pre and intra campaign coordination meetings were held both physical and online and provided updates to stakeholders.
"During implementation, the coordination meetings would receive reports and where gaps were identified such as; Districts that experienced vaccine shortages, mitigation measure to borrow from neighboring districts would be communication and acted on timely."
"Delay in activation of fuel cards, mitigation measures of engaging services providers to issue fuel while the cards were being sorted."
The selection of the VAMs at respective levels was done by MOH and district local governments.
"To provide technical support for vaccine accountability monitoring, the country recruited two regional VAM consultants through UNICEF."
"For any polio exercise that require Oral polio type2, a request has to be made to WHO through GPEI."
The vaccine was delivered to NMS.
"Upon inspection, the online VARs were filled, reviewed and submitted to SD."
The associated supplies were procured through NMS but printing of the forms was handled through UNICEF CO.
Reviewed the plan and request Approved the plan and advised WHOto release n. OPV2 from the Sent an offer letter to the country indicating that the was approved and vaccine allocated Prepared and submitted the Procured and supplied the
At total of 733 usable vials were internally transferred to support these districts.
Vaccine distribution for RND2 was based on the utilization for RND1 factoring the usable balances from RND1.
A total of  vials ( doses) was distributed for RND1&2 as summarized by region below
"C. At district vaccine stores, the vaccine was stored in deep freezers at -ve 20o."
C. At HF level vaccine were stored in refrigerators along with other RI antigens with instructions to label them for campaign only as per GPEI SOPs.
Freezing of the icepacks was done at district vaccine stores.
"The DCCTs were facilitated to ensure that all icepacks are cleaned, refilled with clean water and frozen."
Fuel for generators was provided to facilitate freezing of icepacks.
Vaccine Accountability Monitoring Based on the GPEI recommendations to ensure zero oral polio type2 (n. OPV2) vials remain in the system after the campaign a team of vaccine accountability monitors were recruited through UNICEF to support the process.
Two national vaccine Accountability consultants were recruited to support the training and supervision of other vaccine accountability managers that were deployed to each district to support the vaccine management and accountability process in the country.
"The consultants worked with the National VAM officers and district health teams to identify and train district, sub county and health facility vaccine accountability monitors in a cascaded Vaccine Accountability Monitoring Structure Centrally recruited by UNICEF to support National vaccine accountability monitoring and reporting National VAMs to districts Each district had a VAM officer deployed from National level to support coordinating vaccine accountability All DCCTs were district VAMs to coordinate VAM activities in their districts."
Deployed for each sub county to manage vaccine accountability and supervise health facility VAMs Manage each health facility that was a distribution point in vaccine management and accountability
A total of  vials ( doses) that included  vials distributed for RND2 and  vials that remained from RND1 were accessed for RND2.
Below is a summary of vaccine utilization comparing RND1&2.
No missing or unaccounted for vials were reported during RND2.
Type 2 poliovirus is an eradicated pathogen and so it is critical to have very precise counts of n. OPV2 vaccine vials at each level of the health infrastructure.
"Once all SIA rounds are completed, all unopened vials must be returned to the national vaccine store and no n. OPV2 vial should remain at any level of the health infrastructure."
Form A should be used to report on n. OPV2 stock levels from all administrative areas conducting n. OPV2 SIAs.
Vaccine quantities should be recorded as vials rather than doses.
The vaccine cold chain responsible should fill the form to be reviewed by the immunization programme manager.
The immunization officer responsible at the facility level should report to the district level within 2 days following completion of each SIA round.
The immunization officer responsible at the district/regional level should retrieve all n. OPV2 vials (opened and unopened) within 5 days following the completion of each SIA round and report to the upper level within 7 days.
All unopened vials at the end of each round should be physically counted and their VVM status checked.
"Usable Vials : vials that have not been opened, whose VVM has not passed the discard  point, whose label is legible and whose expiry date has not passed."
"Unusable Vials : empty vials, all opened vials (opened vials must not be reuse the next day), vials with an unreadable label and/or a VVM that has passed the discard point"
There was no reported missing vial during RND2 Instructions to report on utilization of n. OPV2 vials at the end of each SIA round n. OPV2 is a vaccine used exclusively to respond to an outbreak of type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2).
"Type 2 poliovirus is an eradicated pathogen and so it is critical to have very precise counts of n. OPV2 vaccine vials at each level of the health Once all SIA rounds are completed, all unopened vials must be returned to the national vaccine store and no n. OPV2 vial should remain at any level of the health infrastructure."

"In second round, there was effective supportive supervision and monitoring of teams to ensure effective vaccine utilization that also encouraged teams to cross villages when they still had partial vials which minimized As per administrative data, a vaccine wastage rate of 2.04% was reported for national level for RND2."
All the  vials ( unusable and 859 usable vials) were verified by NVAMs and withdraw to NMS is in progress.
"Considering the country context, the country has opted for inactivation and disposal of the vials by incineration using the approved incineration facility at Nakasongola."
"Reported good practice for RND2 The VAMs fast tracked and verified all the usable and unusable vials in time Coordinated distribution of vaccines and supplies to meet the deadline of starting The transport given to NVAMs supported district in distribution of vaccines and supplies, supportive supervision, transfer of vaccines to other districts and timely The recording and reporting of vaccine accountability were timely and enabled early detection of potential vaccine shortage or excess which gave room for interdistrict vials transfer."
There was good vaccine management practice and no reported vials with VVM Timely submission of district Form A
These teams ensured no child under five years of age was missed.
"This approach significantly improved access in high-density urban areas and remote rural regions, ensuring every child was vaccinated regardless of location."
"Fixed and Mobile Vaccination Sites A network of fixed vaccination posts was established in strategic locations such as schools, marketplaces, and other public spaces."
"Mobile vaccination teams were deployed to reach migratory populations, pastoral communities, and remote villages."
These teams operated in coordination with local leaders and community mobilizers to ensure all eligible children were vaccinated.
"To address unique challenges in certain areas, several special strategies were Teams were trained to engage with households refusing vaccination, using community influencers and local leaders to provide accurate information and reassurance."
"In cases of persistent resistance, follow-up visits were scheduled."
"Vaccination efforts in high-risk areas were intensified through micro-targeting approaches, involving additional social mobilizers, security personnel, and logistical Dedicated mobile teams tracked and vaccinated migratory populations, ensuring they were included in the campaigns coverage."
Escorts were provided to vaccination teams to ensure that all villages are reached without interruption.
"Collectively, both rounds of the campaign ensured that more than 100% of the target population was vaccinated, significantly contributing to the interruption of the outbreak and safeguarding the health of vulnerable children."
"Enhanced Logistics Planning: Rapid response teams were established to address vaccine supply issues, ensuring timely delivery and replenishment."
Mobile cold chain units were deployed to maintain vaccine efficacy.
"Misinformation Countermeasures: Social media campaigns, community dialogues, and live Q&A sessions with health experts were used to counter misinformation and address concerns in"
These were supported by the National supervisors deployed with support from WHO to each implementing district.
"These were trained and thereafter deployed to the 4 implementing regions to support training of district supervisors, facilitate district coordination meetings and review of the micro-plans, development of district distribution plans and supervise implementation in the districts."
"The supervisors were deployed for two weeks to ensure proper planning, training and implementation."
"The country also received support from the UNICEF country office of 49 National VAM Consultants who were responsible for cold chain inventory verification, microplanning, and final accountability of Vaccines within the respective districts."
"The Campaign supervision and monitoring was aided by Open Data Kit (ODK) tools which were developed for pre-implementation, implementation and post SIA independent monitoring (IM) and LQAS were used."
"For post SIA monitoring, a total of 49 monitors were trained and deployed to districts implementing both R1 & 2 SIA."
"Daily monitoring review meetings were conducted at the national and district level involving partners and monitors to review performance, discuss challenges and mitigation of intra-campaign issues."
"District level Supervision Supervision at implementation level was done by designated teams from district offices and sub-county supervisors, as well as team (Parish) supervisors."
"At parish level, one supervisor was responsible for about 3-4 vaccination teams."
They were responsible for following up on the Teams based on the Vaccination team deployment plan using the team supervision checklist and rapid convenience monitoring to assess coverage for real time action.
This indicates that a significant proportion of children under five years in these regions have accessed the n. OPV2 vaccines in the two-round campaign.
"Notably, the regions of Mbale, Soroti, and Jinja region recorded coverage rates of 96% or higher, highlighting the success of efforts to reach children under five and provide comprehensive support through vaccination."
Reasons why Fingers were not marked Children absent at the time of vaccination 2.
Some homes were locked and were not revisited to ensure all eligible children are 4.
"At the national level, the data shows that out of  children checked in Round 1, were not vaccinated, resulting in an overall coverage rate of 90%."
"However, there was an improvement in performance during Round 2, out of the total  children checked, 471 were not vaccinated indicating a coverage of 95%."
Sustaining high immunization coverage rates in regions with low numbers of unvaccinated children is crucial.
"Regular monitoring, awareness campaigns, and continued support for vaccination programs are essential to maintain the achieved coverage levels."
"For regions with a significant number of unvaccinated children, targeted interventions should be implemented to in subsequent campaigns to address barriers to immunization, increase access to healthcare services, and enhance"
It was synchronized with Kenya
"A total of  teams, each comprising 1 health worker and 1 recorder, were deployed."
Mobile / roving teams were pivotal in reaching hard to reach areas.
The teams were supported by 1 mobilizer per village to guide the teams to actual houses registered for vaccination.
Teams were allocated based on population estimates of the respective districts with specific targets.
"A target of 125 children per day was allocated for Rural populations whereas a target of 250 children per day was allocated for Urban populations such as cities, municipalities and town councils."
"Round 2 was implemented from Thursday November 7, 2024, to Sunday , 2024, a four-day period designed to reach peak engagement and service delivery across identified regions."
"A total of  teams, each comprising 1 health worker and 1 recorder, were deployed."
Mobile / roving teams were pivotal in reaching hard to reach areas.
The teams were supported by 1 mobilizer per village to guide the teams to actual houses registered for vaccination.
Teams were allocated based on population estimates of the respective districts with specific targets.
"A target of 125 children per day was allocated for Rural populations whereas a target of 250 children per day was allocated for Urban populations such as cities, municipalities and town councils."
This indicates that the vaccination campaigns have been successful in reaching and protecting a substantial proportion of the target population against polio.
"The commitment of healthcare providers, community leaders, and vaccination teams in these districts has played a vital role in achieving these positive outcomes."
It is crucial to sustain and build upon this progress to ensure that all children
"In R2 n. OPV2 campaign, all suspected AFP cases identified by vaccination teams were in R1, a total of true AFP cases was 110."
This is a large number compared to the annual A total of 6 adverse events following immunization were reported in Round 2 and were investigated compared to 28 in Round 1.
"However, there were no serious AESI reported."
"To determine the occurrence of adverse events of special interest (AESI) in children 0-59 months of age vaccinated with n. OPV2 and document the history and medical presentation of AESI detected and to assess causal association between AESI and vaccination, identify possible risk factors and generate safety signals, a sentinel study proposal has been developed and submitted to Centers for Disease Control"
"As part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, this campaign was supported by WHO, UNICEF, and other partners."
"The primary objective was to achieve 95% immunization coverage for children aged 059 months, using a single dose of the Novel Oral Polio Vaccine (n. OPV) to enhance population immunity."
"The survey findings indicate that vaccination coverage was generally high, with 90.1% of children showing a visible vaccination mark, thereby demonstrating adherence to campaign protocol."
"Further analysis of OPV dose administration reveals that while the median dose count was five doses per child, 10.7% of children received fewer than three doses."
"Additionally, although awareness of the SIA was high overalldriven largely by effective communication through community volunteers and radio (reaching 46.5% and 35.3% of the population, respectively)districts such as Amudat and Namayingo recorded lower caregiver awareness, pointing to the need for localized outreach strategies to improve campaign reception."
"First, it is important to ensure timely provision of essential resources, including transportation and allowances, particularly for teams working in remote regions."
"Second, expanding mobilization efforts through trusted local leaders and community-specific campaigns is recommended to increase awareness and reduce caregiver hesitancy in lower-coverage districts."
"Finally, using higher-quality markers can help maintain visible and reliable vaccination marks, thereby facilitating accurate post-campaign verification."
"In , circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (c. VDPV2) was detected in environmental samples from a sewage plant in Doko, Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, intensified immunization efforts to prevent Polio is a highly infectious disease that primarily affects children under five, leading to paralysis or even death."
These campaigns are conducted nationwide as National Immunization Days (NIDs) or in specific high-risk areas as Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs).
The primary objectives were to increase and sustain high population immunity against polio and to enhance the sensitivity of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance.
The specific objective of the LQAS survey were.
A cluster was defined as a Parish with clear administrative boundaries.
All the districts that conducted the house-to-house SIA campaign were assessed.
"In each lot, six clusters were randomly selected by the national LQAS SIAs coordinator using probability proportional to size methods."
Any discrepancies found were updated before sampling the six clusters randomly.
"The target population was children aged 0-59 months living in the area defined as the lot during the campaign, which was the same target population for the SIAs."
"Selection of Households in a Cluster In each cluster, 10 households with eligible children were randomly selected for the survey."
"A household was defined as a group of people who share the same kitchen, or a group of people whose sustainment is provided by the same person(s)."
Selection of the first household in the cluster Surveyors were provided with list of staring villages in each cluster.
The villages were
"The surveyor asked the head of household, parent/caregiver the number of eligible children who belong to the household and were present at the time of the survey, and then asked him/ her to bring all the eligible children out of the house."
"Where an eligible child was found, a questionnaire was administered."
"Where no eligible child was found in the household, the surveyor did not skip the next household."
"When the edge of the village was reached before 10 eligible children in the cluster were surveyed, the surveyor moved to the nearest village in the same Cluster to complete the survey in the cluster."
Ascertaining Vaccination Status Vaccination status of an eligible child was ascertained using a fingermark on the left small finger.
Any child who did not have the fingermark on the left small finger was considered as not vaccinated.
Verbal history was NOT considered.
"During training of the district teams to implement the house to house Polio SIAs, they were guided to apply two drops of OPV to each child aged 0-59 months and mark the left small finger with an indelible ink immediately as evidence of immunization."
"The form contained questions on household location (Lot, Sub County, parish and village); GPS coordinates of the starting village in the lot; date of the survey; number of eligible children (aged months) in the household and those available/seen at the time of the survey; OPV LQAS surveyors and supervisors were trained for 3 days including one day for field practice on the key concepts of LQAS methodology, sampling strategy, data collection, data analysis and interpretation, and the survey instruments (both paper and in ODK software)."
The surveyors were also advised to complete the cluster data collection form in paper as backup.
"Each surveyor was assigned to collect data for a lot, with support of the supervisor where necessary."
Ensuring high coverage across all areas was emphasized as crucial to maintaining community-wide immunity against polio.
"This analysis helped pinpoint districts that may need additional support to ensure consistent dosing, with the goal of optimizing immunity levels in every community."
"The LQAS team also assessed community awareness about polio vaccination, which is essential for encouraging participation and understanding the importance of immunization."
"They discussed districts with high awareness levels and successful outreach efforts, as well as areas where awareness was comparatively low."
"Recommendations focused on strengthening information dissemination and community engagement in regions where awareness about polio prevention and the vaccination campaign was less robust, helping to enhance future participation and support for immunization initiatives."
"The mean age was 26.3 months (SD = 16.6 months), aligning with the primary target for polio vaccination."
"Notably, 22.8% of the children were under 12 months, underscoring the importance of early vaccination for this higher-risk age group."
"Additionally, 16.8% were over 48 months, indicating the need to maintain vaccine outreach for older children within the 059-month target range."
"A total of  children aged 0-59 months from districts, including 4 cities, were evaluated for the presence of a visible finger mark on the little finger of the left hand as evidence of vaccination during the Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA)."
"Addressing these gaps will be essential in bolstering the accuracy of vaccination tracking and ensuring comprehensive Exhibit 3: Reasons contributing to the absence of a finger mark However, 9.9% of children were without a visible finger mark, indicating areas of improvement in marking practices and campaign coverage."
"Notably, certain districts showed higher counts of unmarked children, which may reflect logistical challenges, marking inconsistencies, or other regional factors."
This was greatly improved in Round 2.
"These findings indicate that while the OPV campaign was largely successful in some areas, there is a critical need to address specific challenges in lowerperforming districts to ensure full immunization coverage and mitigate polio risks."
"The mark was applied to the wrong finger or incorrectly, leading to no visible mark on the left finger The household was not visited by the vaccination team due to scheduling or logistical challenges."
"The child was away when the vaccination team visited, often due to family obligations or mobility."
"Compliance Some caregivers may have refused the vaccination, though this was Includes issues like administrative errors, unavailability of marking ink,"
"Moderate Fail (26.7% of Districts)-12 districts for Round 1 and 10% - 5 Districts for Round 2  were classified as Moderate Fail, with 4-8 unvaccinated children per district."
"Districts such as Amudat, Budaka, Bududa, Bukwo, Busia, Butaleja, Mayuge, Mbale, Napak, and Soroti City are in this category for Round 1 and Amudat for Round 2, highlighting the need for targeted support to improve coverage in future campaigns."
"Butebo and Jinja Cityin Round 1 were classified as Very Poor Fail, with more than 19 unvaccinated children."
"However, no district was in this category in round 2."
"These districts face higher risks of polio outbreaks, especially due to the presence of mobile populations and foreign communities, which can affect consistent immunization access."
"On the other hand, caregivers who were aware of AFP had an average of 5.14 OPV doses administered to their children."
This suggests that caregivers who are knowledgeable about AFP tend to have children who receive more doses of the Oral Polio Vaccine.
The goal was to ensure thorough mobilization and implementation of the SIA to reach all children aged 059 months.
"The lower awareness in these districts highlights challenges that may include limited access to reliable information sources, lower engagement from local leaders, or logistical barriers in reaching more isolated communities."
These areas may require additional targeted communication efforts in future campaigns to ensure full community readiness.
"Overall, while caregiver awareness was high in many districts, certain areas require focused improvements."
"Strategies that proved successful in high-awareness regions, such as Moroto and Bukedea, could be adapted and implemented in districts with lower awareness levels to enhance community engagement and support for upcoming A wide variety of communication methods were utilized to overcome barriers to vaccination, such as low motivation, mistrust, and lack of awareness about routine immunization."
"Door-to-door mobilization efforts were particularly emphasized, with Village Health Teams (VHTs) and local leaders visiting households, markets, churches, shops, playgrounds, and schools to ensure that every household was informed and motivated to vaccinate their children."
The following channels were identified as the most effective sources of awareness among caregivers and the public:
"Given AFPs critical role in polio surveillance and early detection, increasing caregiver knowledge is essential to prompt recognition and reporting of potential cases."
"Enhancing awareness can improve early identification of AFP symptoms, supporting better surveillance and response to potential polio cases."
"Therefore, future outreach efforts should prioritize raising awareness about AFP, especially in regions with historically low coverage, to strengthen community involvement in polio prevention and overall health vigilance."
"Vaccination Marking Challenges In many districts such as Bududa and Soroti, the markers used were of low quality, causing the vaccination marks on childrens fingers to fade or wash off."
"Some children were marked on the wrong finger or not marked at all, indicating gaps in training and adherence to marking protocols."
"Awareness and Community Engagement Some parents were unaware of the vaccination campaign, especially in areas with limited community mobilization or lower literacy rates."
"This issue contributed to In certain areas, caregivers were hesitant or outright refused to vaccinate their children, which calls for enhanced persuasion efforts and education on vaccine Households Not Visited: Some vaccination teams did not reach all households in certain clusters, leaving eligible children unvaccinated."
This was sometimes due to teams camping at trading centers rather than conducting thorough houseto-house visits.
"Passive resistance observed among village guides in Namisindwa, expecting Bududa community members were reluctant to engage, fearing potential Areas with mobile or nomadic populations posed challenges for consistent outreach and tracking, leading to lower coverage rates."
Ensuring that resources are appropriately allocated and that staff members are adequately trained and equipped is essential for achieving
"Independent monitoring of Polio SIAs, 2022 A total of  children aged 059 months were evaluated in Round 1 and a total of  were evaluated in Round 2."
"Of those present in the households,  (92%) were vaccinated and finger marked in Round 1 and  (96%) were vaccinated and finger marked in Round 2."
Mop-ups were done after the staggering dates for districts that did not implement in the initial allocated
"Challenges to campaign implementation Challenges were mainly extracted from the district reports submitted to the National EOC and they include but are not limited to the following; Sub optimal budget fingers; 40 villages were missed in the budget, little fuel for failure of timely last mile delivery of logistics Late supply of fuel to supervisors; Supervisors accessed fuel lately on the implementation day despite the timely arrival of Fuel cards."
The 2 indelible   ink markers allocated per vaccination team were inadequate since the teams have to vaccinate in more than 3 villages for example Kaliro The teams allocated were very limited and this caused the vaccination teams move to more than three villages in the four   days of implementation.
The Indelible ink markers quality was not good and most fingers marked were observed to be fading away on the next day.
This was addressed through engagements.
"House hold registration forms were not delivered among the logistic delivered, necessitating the District to print them out."
The compressed schedule for key campaign activities was straining for human and logistical resources.
"Vaccinators, VHTs and LC1s were dissatisfied with the payment process of the transport allowances that had been provided."
Inadequate funds allocated for example Napak District has 14 sub-counties which are so distant and has no provision for the hard to reach supervisors.
"No clear and adequate facilitation for the DHO Inadequate vaccines to complete the campaign ODK app was not functional, supervisors faced challenges using it."
Vaccination of targeted children in schools on first day of implementation was very helpful and most nursery kids were reached.
"To provide standard Tally sheet well labelled at the back of the sheet Provision of protective gears such as umbrellas, gumboots, raincoats, clear paper Inter country campaigns should start at the same time."
Schools should be called off during campaigns We need to deploy static teams at the port of entry to avoid leakage The security personnel should be budged and deployed officially next campaigns The 2 round Outbreak Response SIA in the 49 districts and 4 regions was successfully implemented from 3rd  6th October and 7th  10th .
The proportion of lots that passed the survey in R2 was almost double that of the R1 coverage indicating also that the quality of the campaign was much improved.
"In this campaign, great lessons were learnt as well as best practices and challenges documented with a view to improve subsequent rounds."
"This achievement is mainly attributed to the commitment and remarkable resilience of district and sub county supervisors, DCCT and vigilance of the district bio stat in empowering teams to report promptly and timely data entry."
"However, inadequate funding due to under budgeting caused failure for timely lastmile vaccine delivery, late distribution of fuel to supervisor, noninvolvement of district drivers  lack of adequate transport for distribution, poor quality of indelible ink, poor vaccine accountability due to suboptimal competencies of recruited VAMS, inadequate IEC materials, delayed report submission, low turn up for day review meetings were the major hindrances that stumbled the campaign."

The latest edition of the World health statistics provides an essential examination of trends in global health over the past two decades that have shaped the world in which we live.
"It highlights the sobering reality that, due largely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have both regressed to the level a decade ago, although the impact was unequal across regions and income groups."
"This holds true for every WHO region except the African Region, where communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions are still responsible for over half of all deaths."
"Globally, the rate of improvement in healthy life expectancy has slowed in recent years, reflecting the increasing burden of NCDs, and the need to strengthen health systems to improve quality of care and meet increasing demands."
"At the heart of this years report is a critical call to action to accelerate progress towards the triple billion targets set out in WHOs 13th General Programme of Work, and the Sustainable Development Goals on which they are based."
"Globally, 585million more people are expected to be covered by essential health services without catastrophic health spending by 2025 than in 2018  just over halfway to the target of 1billion  and 777million more people are expected to be better protected from health emergencies."
"Healthier populations provide the sole bright spot, where an estimated 1.5billion more people will enjoy healthier lives by 2025."
"Overall, however, progress is insufficient to achieve the health-related SDG These gaps reflect huge, missed opportunities in improving global health, and underscore the urgency for the global community to intensify efforts and investments in health."
Country-focused stories are presented throughout the report to highlight efforts undertaken to address various health issues.
The information presented in World health statistics is based on data available from global monitoring as of .
"The data reference years vary, however, as data series are updated on different timelines and with different lag between the data reference year and the publication year."
Data have been compiled primarily from publications and databases produced and managed by WHO or United Nations partner entities and supplemented with data and analyses from peer-reviewed publications.
"The WHO regions most affected were the Region of the Americas and South-East Asia Region, with declines of about 3 years in life expectancy and 2.5 years in HALE between 2019 and 2021."
"In the Region of the Americas it was the number one cause of death in both years, and ranked in the top five causes for all regions except for the African and Western At the midway point for the SDGs, progress on health-related Goals has been mixed."
"None of these have yet been achieved, and none are on track under current trends."
"However, most indicators  are showing movement in the right direction globally."
"The world is also off-track to achieve the universal health coverage (UHC), health emergencies preparedness and healthier populations Triple Billion targets by 2025."
"From the 2018 baselines, 585million more people are expected to have access to essential health services without incurring catastrophic health spending by 2025, well short of the one billion UHC target."
"For health emergency preparedness, 777million more people are expected to be protected by 2025, again short of the target."
"Healthier populations is the sole area positioned to meet its one billion target, with 1.5billion additional people anticipated to be living healthier lives by 2025."
"In 2022, worldwide over one billion people aged 5years and over were living with obesity, while over half a billion were underweight."
"In the same year, 148million children under five were affected by stunting, 45million suffered from wasting and 37million were living with overweight."
Double-duty actions that efficiently and effectively address both facets of malnutrition are critical to make the most of limited resources.
"Refugees and migrants are not inherently less healthy than host populations, yet various suboptimal health determinants  further exacerbated by linguistic, cultural, legal and other barriers  mean that they often experience significant health disparities."
"Access to health care is often limited for refugees and migrants, with only half of the 84 countries surveyed between 2018 and 2021 providing them access to government-funded health services on par with nationals."
The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in population health across the globe.
"The devastating impacts of the pandemic on health, economy, families and society have been observed worldwide since 2020 and are expected to continue to unfold in the years to come."
"However, the COVID-19 pandemic reversed this trend and wiped out the progress that was made in nearly a decade within just two years."
"However, the decline for men was relatively more evenly split in 2020 (by 0.8years) and 2021 (by 0.9years), while the decline for women was concentrated more in 2021 (by 1.3years) than in 2020 (by 0.5years)."
"Similar disparity between sexes was observed for HALE: HALE among men dropped by 0.7years to 61.6 (UI: 60.962.4)years in and another 0.8years to 60.9 (UI: 60.161.6)years in 2021, and HALE among women dropped by 0.5years to Prior to the pandemic, life expectancy and HALE had risen across all WHO regions and World Bank country income groups between 2000 and 2019 (Figs 1.2 and 1.3)."
The greatest gains were seen in low-resources settings including the African Region (11.2-year gain in life expectancy and 9.8-year gain in HALE) and the South-East Asia Region (7.3-year gain in life expectancy and 6.5-year gain in HALE); and in low-income countries (10.6-year gain in life expectancy and 9.3-year gain in HALE).
"However, the pace of improvement in high-income countries has stagnated since 2010, with only a 1.1-year increase in life expectancy and a 0.6-year increase in HALE in , less than one third of the increases in low-income countries over the same period ."
"Trends in life expectancy and HALE at birth, by sex and World Bank income group, Upper-middle-income Life expectancy at birth (years) Life expectancy at birth (years) Healthy life expectancy at birth (years) In addition, the impact of the pandemic was unequal across regions and income groups."
The Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region have been the hardest hit: life expectancy in both regions dropped by 3.0years and HALE by 2.5years between 2019 and 2021.
"The Western Pacific Region was the least affected during the first two years of the pandemic, with less than 0.1years and 0.2years of loss seen for life expectancy and HALE, respectively."
It was the only WHO region in which increases in life expectancy (0.2-year gain) and HALE (0.1-year gain) were observed in 2020.
"By World Bank income groups, life expectancy was cut by 0.6years in low-income countries and by 2.4years in lower-middle-income countries, and HALE cut by 0.6years and 2.0years, respectively, between 2019 and 2021."
"In low-income countries, the worsening of longevity was rather minimal in 2020, associated with only 2% (0.01 of 0.55years) of the decline in life expectancy (Fig."
"Simultaneously, the share of NCD deaths dropped to 69.9% in 2020 and to 65.3% in 2021, and the share of injury deaths dropped to just about 7% in both Composition of causes of death, global, Percentage (%) Communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions Note: In countries that have low-quality vital registration, WHOs current estimates include a cause of death category, other pandemic-related mortality (OPRM), which could include underlying causes of deaths from any of the three groups."
"The graph only shows the relative composition of the three groups; OPRM is not Life expectancy, healthy life expectancy and burden of disease"
"Similarly, the Western Pacific Region has seen limited change since in the distribution across the three categories, with NCDs accounting for about 88% and communicable diseases for about 6% of all deaths (Fig."
"However, the pandemic has been more disruptive to the expected trajectories in other WHO regions."
Similar disparity was also observed across World Bank income groups (Fig.
"The graph only shows the relative composition of the three groups; OPRM is not World health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals"
"Composition of causes of death, by World Bank income group, Upper-middle-income Communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions Note: In countries that have low-quality vital registration, WHOs current estimates include a cause of death category, other pandemic-related mortality (OPRM), which could include underlying causes of deaths from any of the three groups."
The graph only shows the relative composition of the three groups; OPRM is not These patterns are the result of a combination of transitioning cause-of-death profiles and changing population structure.
"While the global improvement up to 2019 was primarily driven by the progress in the African Region (56.1% decline), South-East Asia Region (63.3% decline) and Eastern Mediterranean Region (47.4% decline), the Region of the Americas and the European Region were hardest hit by the pandemic in relative terms, with ASDR from communicable diseases more than tripled (3.4 and 3.8 times, respectively) between 2019 and 2021."
"In comparison, the African and Western Pacific regions only experienced moderate increases (14.3% and 11.9% increase, Progress was also made in all WHO regions in for mortality from NCDs (except for the South-East Asia Region) and mortality from injuries (except for the Eastern Mediterranean Region), leading to 18.8% reduction in ASDR from NCDs and 23.1% reduction in ASDR from injuries globally in ."
"The COVID-19 pandemic reversed the declining trend in ASDR for communicable diseases in all income groups to the extent that the level in 2021 that was above the 2000 level in upper-income countries and nearly double the 2000 level in high-income countries; thus, undoing over two decades of work ."
"In 2019, seven of the leading causes were NCDs and the remaining three The pace of transition was uneven across regions and income groups."
The only communicable disease that ranked among the top 10 in these regions or income groups were lower respiratory infections .
"Overall progress has been observed for mortality-related SDG indicators; however, the current trends are not strong enough to reach the targets by 2030."
"Since the turn of the millennium, enhancing the health of mothers and children has been a top priority for global development."
"An estimated 287000 (80% UI: ) women globally died from a maternal cause in 2020, a number that remained unacceptably high and is equivalent to almost 800 deaths every day or The African Region remained the region with the highest MMR throughout the two decades, despite a sustained decline with an ARR of 2%."
"Increasing MMRs were seen in the Region of the Americas, the European Region and Western Pacific Region between 2016 and 2020, despite the sizable decline during the MDG era."
"However, the levels of MMR have remained below 80 deaths per 100000 live births in these three regions since 2000 ."
"To achieve the SDG global target of MMR below 70 deaths per 100000 live births by 2030, an ARR of 11.6% is required between 2021 and 2030, equivalent to over 1million deaths averted, compared with a scenario where the global stagnation continues (2, 3)."
Mortality among children under 5years of age and among newborns Substantial global progress has been made in reducing childhood mortality since 2000.
Children in the African Region continued to have the highest risk of dying before reaching the age of five.
"In fact, the African Region accounted for over half (2.7million, 90% UI: 2.53.2million) of the total under-five deaths in 2022, while only accounting for 30% of the global live At the country level, U5MRs in 2022 ranged from 1.5 (90% UI: 0.73.1) deaths per 1000 live births to 117.3 (90% UI: 93.3147.7) deaths per 1000 live births, which means that the risk of dying before turning five for a child born in the highest-mortality country was about 80 times that in the lowest-mortality country ."
"However, the decline in global neonatal deaths from 2000 to 2020, at 44%, has been slower compared with the 56% drop in the number of deaths among children aged 159months during the The chances of survival from birth varies widely depending on where a child is born."
"With country-level NMRs in 2022 ranging from 0.7 (90% UI: 0.31.5) deaths per 1000 live births to 39.4 (90% UI: 10.8108.7) deaths per 1000 live births across the world, the risk of a newborn dying before their 28th day of life in the highest-mortality country was almost 60 times that in the lowest-mortality country ."
Progress in reducing U5MR and NMR slowed in the first half of the SDG era () compared with what was achieved in the MDG era ().
Even more countries are at risk of missing the SDG target for NMR (12 or fewer deaths per 1000 live births by 2030): 64 countries will need to accelerate the mortality decline to meet the target on time.
"The majority of the countries not on track to achieve the SDG targets are in the African Region, reinforcing the fact that children face different chances of survival depending on where they are born."
Declines in CDRs were observed in all regions in the period.
"However, the region with the highest CDR in 2021 (the African Region, at 19.4 [(UI: 16.422.4]) per 100000 population) still had a CDR that was nearly three times as high as in the region with the lowest CDR (the European Region, at 6.7 [UI: 6.27.3] per population)."
"The Region of the Americas was the only region where overall increase was seen, rising from 7.2 (UI: 6.67.8) per 100000 in 2000 Globally, the rate of suicide deaths for men was more than double that for women in 2021 (CDR 12.3 [UI: 9.615.4] per 100000 population versus 5.9 [UI: 4.27.7] per population)."
"However, the sex disparity was uneven across regions, with a male-to-female ratio ranging from as low as 1.4 in the South-East Asia Region to nearly 4.0 in the Region of the Americas (Fig."
"In contrast, about a quarter of the global population resides in the Western Pacific Region, but this region accounted for only 6.2% of global homicide deaths, with a CDR (1.6 [UI: 1.12.1] per population) that was 8% of that in the highest region (Region of the Americas, 19.4 (UI: 16.522.7) per population) and just about 16% of that in the second highest (African Region, 9.6 [UI: 5.915.1] per Crude death rate (per population) Crude death rate (per population) World health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals"
"Compared with the Region of the Americas and the African Region, the CDR of homicide was also relatively low in the European, South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, at 2.6 (UI: 2.13.3) per 100000 population, 3.7 (UI: 2.75.0) per population and 5.4 (UI: 3.28.6) per 100000 population, Men and women face disproportionate risk of homicide deaths, and the sex disparity was unevenly distributed across WHO regions."
"Globally, the male-to-female ratio for CDR for homicide mortality in 2021 was 4.0, ranging from about 2.8 in the South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and European regions to 7.1 in the Region of the Americas."
"A strong age pattern was also observed, with young adults at age 2024 years having the highest age-specific mortality rate, peaking at 12.7 (UI: 9.517.1) deaths per 100000 population globally and up to 40.6 (UI: 36.145.3) deaths per 100000 population in the Region of the Americas (Fig."
"The highest CDR in 2021 was observed in the African Region at 1.2 (UI: 0.72.2) per 100000 population, closely followed by the Western Pacific Region at just under 1.2 (UI: 0.51.7) per population."
"The greatest decline in CDR was achieved in the European Region, with a nearly two thirds drop between 2000 and 2021."
Slight increases were seen in the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Sex and age disparity were observed.
Men were dying at a rate that was 68% higher than women.
"The greatest male-to-female ratios were observed in the Region of the Americas and the European Region at 2.3 and 2.6, respectively, whereas the lowest ratio was in the African Region at 1.4."
"The youngest and the oldest population were at the highest risk of dying from unintentional poisoning, with population under 5 years old and 65 years old and over accounting for less than 20% of the global population but nearly 40% of the global deaths from unintentional poisoning in 2021 ."
"The other three regions started at similar levels (22.223.9%) in 2000; however, the African Region saw more moderate decline (10.9%) and reached a premature mortality risk of 21.3% (UI: 13.531.3%) in 2019, whereas the fastest declines among all regions were observed in the European and Western Pacific regions (32.0% and 28.0% decline, respectively) Despite the progress made, the pace of change in most countries has slowed since the beginning of the SDG era in 2015."
"With the global ARR slowing significantly (more than halved compared with the first 15 years of the century) between 2015 and 2019 to under 1%, the world is not on track to reach the 2030 SDG target."
"The only region where some acceleration was seen was the Eastern Mediterranean Region, yet the accelerated ARR was still less than half of that required to meet the SDG target."
"The region of most concern in meeting the target is South-East Asia Region, where the previous overall slow but still declining trend in has reversed, with an increase in premature NCD mortality in ."
"The latter may well be an artefact, as patients with Trajectories of NCD mortality after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being understood."
"In countries that have low-quality vital registration, WHOs current estimates include a cause of death category, other pandemic-related mortality, that likely includes NCD mortality."
NCDs are also at greater danger of dying prematurely from COVID-19 as a competing risk (and so recorded as COVID-19 deaths).
There are still many unknowns around the progress in NCD premature mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic that can only be answered with more and better cause of death data to document the trends during and after the pandemic.
"First, they are due to the different (population-weighted) ambient and household particulate matter concentrations, but the different population distribution by age and underlying mortality patterns by cause also play a role."
"Mortality attributed to unsafe WASH Unsafe WASH can lead to undesired health outcomes, including deaths."
"SDG indicator 3.9.2 is defined as mortality rate attributed to unsafe WASH, and considers four health conditions in the estimation, namely diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, undernutrition and soil-transmitted helminthiases."
"The latest estimate suggests that globally in 2019, safe WASH could have prevented 1.4million (UI: 1.31.5million) deaths."
"Among WHO regions, the highest mortality rates in 2019 were in the African Region (46.7deaths per 100000 population) and the South-East Asia Region (29.6 deaths per 100000 population) ."
"The World health statistics 2023 revealed that not only have many advances attained in the MDG era () stalled since 2015, but the COVID-19 pandemic has further hampered improvements since 2020 ."
SDG indicators related to mortality are
Percentage change in HIV incidence rate was calculated from unrounded incidence rates.
"At the end of 2022, there were an estimated 39.0million (UI: 33.145.7million) people living with HIV globally, of which 37.5million (UI: 31.843.6million) were aged 15years or older and 1.5million (UI: 1.22.1million) were children aged under 15 years ."
"In 2022, there were 1.3million (UI: 1.01.7million) new HIV infections globally."
"The global HIV incidence rate (number of new HIV infections per uninfected population, SDG indicator 3.3.1) was (UI: 0.190.33) in 2015."
"The Eastern Mediterranean Region has seen a 45% increase in HIV incidence rate since 2015, although it still had the lowest number of new infections across WHO regions in 2022."
"HIV incidence rate declined by 31% during the same period in the South-East Asia Region, where both incidence rate and number are among the lowest."
"The latest estimates suggest that while the world is moving in the right direction, it is still far from An estimated 10.6million (UI: 9.911.4million) people developed TB globally in 2022, of which 55% were men, 33% were women and 12% were children under 15 years of age."
"Globally, the net relative reduction in the TB incidence rate from 2015 to 2022 was 8.7%, falling far behind the WHO End TB strategy milestone ."
"Nevertheless, there were encouraging signs of progress."
"In 2022, there were an estimated 249million (UI: 225278million) malaria cases in 85 endemic countries and areas, leading to an estimated 631000 (UI: ) deaths ."
"In 2022, the incidence rate was 58.4 (UI: 52.965.3); the expected rate was 26.2 if it was on trajectory to reach GTS targets."
"If the current trends continue, it is unlikely that the GTS incidence targets will be achieved) ."
"Children under the age of five are particularly vulnerable; in 2022, almost four in every five malaria deaths in the region were among these young children ."
"The first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S), was recommended by WHO in 2021 after successful pilot programmes in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi through the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (Box 2.1)."
Wide implementation of malaria vaccines is expected to save tens of thousands of lives each year.
"Box 2.1	 Malaria vaccine implementation in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) was established by WHO to evaluate the public health use of the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 ."
"Through the collaborative effort with the ministries of health in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi from 2019 to 2023, the RTS,Smalaria vaccine was integrated into routine child immunization services as part of each countrys national malaria control programme."
This is not just a scientific breakthrough but a life-saving intervention that can significantly reduce the burden of malaria on our communities.
Measured impact was additional to the benefits from insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) use and access to other child health interventions and care.
"These findings were measured in the context of vaccine scale-up, with an average third-dose coverage of about 68% and average fourth-dose coverage of about 40% across the three countries."
The substantial public health impact of malaria vaccine is expected to increase as vaccine coverage increases.
"Malaria vaccine uptake is high, with no unintended consequences, such as reduction in ITN use, uptake of other childhood vaccines or change in health-seeking behaviour."
Community demand for and health worker acceptance of malaria vaccine is high.
The malaria vaccine has a good safety profile  with more than 6million doses provided.
"In the three pilot countries, malaria vaccine even reached children who were not using other forms of malaria prevention, thereby extending the programmatic reach of malaria prevention interventions."
The MVIP further established that a moderately efficacious malaria vaccine can have high effectiveness and impact and will be accepted by communities and health workers.
"The MVIP also provided critical information to inform the recently updated WHO recommendation for malaria vaccines that applies to both RTS,Sand R21 vaccines, and forged a pathway for future malaria vaccine The high demand for malaria vaccines is unprecedented."
"More than 20 countries have been approved for malaria vaccine introduction support by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and wider implementation began in 2024."
"As of 25 , eight countries in Africa offer the malaria vaccine as part of their childhood immunization programmes (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi and Sierra Leone) and up to 10 additional countries are likely to introduce it this year."
At least 30 countries in Africa are interested in deploying malaria vaccines as part of their national malaria control plans.
"Globally, an estimated 304million people were living with chronic hepatitis Band Cin 2022, of whom 254million were living with hepatitis Band 50million with hepatitis C. The estimated number of people newly infected by viral hepatitis Band Cdeclined from 2.5million in 2019 to 2.2million in 2022 ."
"While this decline is encouraging, it is still far from the 2030 targets of 170000 new hepatitis Binfections and 350000 new hepatitis Cinfections ."
"Of the 2.2million new infections in 2022, more than 1.2million (UI: 0.81.5million) were hepatitis Band nearly 1.0million (UI: 0.81.3million) hepatitis C ."
"There is, however, promising momentum in the region, as Egypt became the first country to achieve the gold tier status on the path to eliminating hepatitis Cinfection (Box 2.2)."
"Thirteen of the 21 diseases or groups of disease recognized by WHO as NTDs are targeted for eradication, elimination of transmission or elimination as a public health problem, and 50 countries have eliminated at least one NTD."
"Bangladesh, for example, has recently eliminated lymphatic filariasis and visceral leishmaniasis as a public health problem (Box 2.3)."
"This is an encouraging sign that NTDs can be defeated by combining diverse interventions including mass and individual treatment, vector control, veterinary public health, and provision of safe water and sanitation."
"In recent years, the world has faced multiple challenges in the fight against NTDs, including a slow recovery of NTD programmes after the massive service disruption at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, an uncertain financial situation and the everincreasing threat of climate change, which is likely to result in increased distribution of many NTDs ."
This means that Egypt has fulfilled WHOs targets that will set the country up to achieve the reduced incidence and mortality targets of full elimination before 2030.
Egypt has implemented one of the worlds largest nationwide public health screening and treatment programmes for hepatitis C. Egypt had one of the highest rates of viral hepatitis in the world.
"Since the early 1990s, the government has put a huge effort into strengthening hepatitis prevention, with programmes covering blood safety, infection control and injection safety."
"Egypt launched a network of specialized treatment centres in 2006 and, with the new antiviral medicines discovered in 2014, hepatitis testing and treatment were made accessible and free of charge for everyone."
"In 2018, the government launched the presidential initiative 100million seha (100million healthy lives), a massive and unprecedented nationwide campaign to detect and treat everyone with hepatitis C, escalating its Through the campaign, everyone over 18 was tested, later expanding to children 12 years and older."
"Vulnerable communities such as refugees and migrants, and persons with disabilities were also included, to leave no one behind."
"Between 2018 and 2022, over 60million people were tested with WHO-approved rapid diagnostic tests."
"Patients were also assessed and treated for other chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes."
"A total of 4.1million received treatment for hepatitis Cwith locally manufactured medicines between 2014 and 2022, of which 98% were virally suppressed."
"Expanding direct public health approaches to community prevention, testing and treatment, as shown by Egypts successful public health programme to eliminate hepatitis C, can have a population-wide impact."
The country achieved the elimination target of less than one case per 10000 population at the sub-district (upazila) level in 2017 and has sustained it to date despite disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kala azar is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is transmitted by sandflies; it is commonly prevalent among the most disadvantaged rural communities.
"The disease leads to symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and spleen and liver enlargement and, if left untreated, can prove fatal in over 95% of cases."
"In 2023, Bangladesh was also validated as the fourth country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem, after Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand."
"Lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquito bites."
"The infection is usually acquired in childhood with painful and disfiguring visible manifestations appearing much later in life, often in the form of enlargement of body parts, causing pain, severe disability and associated stigma."
Lymphatic filariasis was a major public health problem in Bangladesh and was endemic in 19 of its 64 districts.
"Between 2001 and 2015, high-coverage mass drug administration campaigns were carried out in all endemic districts."
"A series of transmission assessment surveys was carried out by programme personnel between 2011 and 2021, which demonstrated that transmission levels were below the threshold established by WHO for elimination as a public health problem."
"Notably, over 31000 people affected by lymphatic filariasis have been trained in self-care and provided with kits to manage their disease condition and improve their quality of life."
Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious viral disease.
"It primarily affects children under 5 years of age, but an unvaccinated person at any age can contract the disease."
"Of the three strains of wild poliovirus (type 1, type 2 and type 3), wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999 and wild poliovirus type 3 was eradicated in 2020."
"In 2023, a total of 12 cases of wild poliovirus were reported in Afghanistan and Pakistan and, unlike in previous years, no cases were reported from non-endemic Although immunization coverage, including polio, began to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2022, progress is uneven."
There were 14.3million children missing out on any vaccination  the so-called zero-dose children  worldwide in 2022.
"Afghanistan and Pakistan were among the top 15 countries with the highest number of zero-dose children in 2022, highlighting the need for continued, intensified efforts to reach all remaining un- or under-immunized children in 2.1.7	 Antimicrobial resistance AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels."
"It is a complex problem that requires both sectorspecific actions in the human health, food production, animal and environmental sectors, and a coordinated approach across these sectors."
"However, in 2023 only 27% of countries reported implementing their national action plans effectively and only 11% had allocated national budgets SDG indicator 3.d.2 is defined as the percentage of bloodstream infections due to selected antimicrobialresistant organisms."
"Median resistance to thirdgeneration cephalosporins in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were 41% and 32% in 2021, respectively, compared with 26.9% and 13.4% in 2016."
"However, no conclusions can be made on whether changes in resistance have occurred over time."
"The reasons for this are twofold: first, the pool of reporting countries has changed significantly over the years."
"Second, the number of resource-limited settings providing data has increased in recent years."
"Testing coverage in these settings is often low, with data often limited to tertiary and biased towards complex infections and treatment failures."
Higher median resistance in recent years is at least in part consistent with potential biases resulting from the convenience sampling of health facilities for reporting AMR data in many settings .
"The overall goal is to reduce the use of Watch and reserve group antibiotics and to increase the relative benefit and the availability of Access group antibiotics, where needed."
"A risk factor for health is any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases their likelihood of developing a disease or injury."
"This section presents progress towards achieving SDG and GPW13 targets related to several risk factors 2.2.1	 Nutritional risk factors Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, lower risk of NCDs, and longevity."
Women with anaemia are more likely to experience fatigue and impaired physical capacity in their daily lives.
Moderate and severe anaemia are also risk factors for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
While there was a slight decrease in anaemia prevalence among pregnant women from 40.9% (UI: prevalence among non-pregnant women remained 26.632.5) in 2019 .
"This latest evidence suggests that the global target of 50% reduction of anaemia in women of reproductive age by (from a 2012 baseline) is unlikely to be met (27, 28)."
Intake of TFA is associated with increased risk of heart attacks and death from coronary heart disease.
"WHO designated TFA elimination as one of its priority targets in 2018, calling for the global elimination of industrially Mandatory TFA policies are currently in effect in 69 countries in all WHO regions, covering 55% of the global population (4.4billion people)."
"Of these countries, 53 have best-practice policies, which include mandatory national limit of 2g of industrially produced TFA per 100g of total fat in all foods and mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils as an ingredient in all foods."
Population coverage by best-practice TFA policies has grown considerably.
"In 2018, best-practice policies were in effect for just 6% of the global population (480million people)."
"By the end of 2023, this has increased to 46% coverage (3.7billion people) ."
"However, accelerated actions are needed to meet the target of 100% global population 2.2.2	 Behavioural risk factors Modifiable behaviours such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet are among the known risk factors associated with NCDs."
"The Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs , which has been extended until 2030, includes a target for reducing the global prevalence of tobacco use by 30% by the year 2025, relative to 2010 In 2022, the global age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older (SDG indicator 3.a.1) was estimated at 20.9% (UI: 18.822.9), a 21% relative decline from 26.4% in 2010."
"While this is short of the 30% reduction target, progress is encouraging as tobacco use has been declining in all WHO regions."
"The South-East Asia Region, having consistently the highest prevalence since 2000, is projected to achieve a 34% reduction by relative to 2010."
The African Region is expected to reach a 32% relative reduction by 2025 and remain the region with the lowest prevalence.
"The European Region, in contrast, is projected to have the highest prevalence across all WHO regions in 2030 at 23.1% ."
"Netherlands (Kingdom of the) is among the countries to have experienced a decline in tobacco use faster than the European regional average, and one of only four countries worldwide to have attained best-practice level adoption of all MPOWER measures3 (Box 2.4) (33, 34)."
"While the prevalence among both men and women has decreased since 2000, it has remained much higher among men than women in 2022, both globally and in all six WHO Box 2.4	 Tobacco control in the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) The estimated age-standardized prevalence of tobacco use among persons aged 15 years and older in the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) declined from 34.5% (UI: 27.741.2) in 2000 to 27.7% (UI: 23.332.2) in 2010 and 21.3% (UI: 17.125.5) in 2022."
"If current trends continue, the prevalence is projected to reduce further to around 19.9% (UI: 15.824.1) in 2025 ."
"On average, prevalence in the WHO European Region is projected to reduce more slowly, by 17% over the same period."
The prevalence among both men and women in the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) has been declining at a faster pace than the European Region averages; the prevalence among women in the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) has been declining remarkably faster than the European Region average (Fig.
The Netherlands (Kingdom of the) has a long history of tobacco control dating back to the 1950s.
"Establishment of a new, toll-free national 2018: Signing of National Prevention Agreement (NPA) by the government and 70 organizations to address tobacco use (among other risk factors), with the aim that, by 2040, the country would have less than 5% of its population as smokers, and no children or pregnant women smoking."
"Over recent years, the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) has increased excise tax on tobacco products, which has led to real price increases over time (14% above inflation over the past 10 years)."
"In the 2023 WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, the Netherlands (Kingdom of the) is featured as one of only four countries in the world that have attained best-practice level adoption of all MPOWER measures  WHOs technical package that assists countries to implement the evidence-based demand-reduction measures of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ."
"SDG indicator 3.5.2 is defined as total (recorded and unrecorded) alcohol per capita consumption (APC) per year, adjusted for tourist consumption, in persons aged years and older, measured in litres of pure alcohol."
"Comparing this pace of decline with the global targets of at least 10% reduction by 2025 and at least 20% by 2030, it is evident that acceleration is needed (31, 36, 37)."
"Despite consistent reduction since 2000, including 9.8% reduction since 2010, the European Region continued to have the highest total APC."
"The South-East Asia Region is the only region where total APC has continuously increased, although the rise has considerably slowed since 2010."
"As with tobacco use, globally alcohol consumption among men has been consistently higher than among women."
"The preliminary global estimate for total APC in 2020 is World health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals"
"Box 2.5	 Sex-related inequalities in the global and regional levels of Globally, there are sex-related inequalities in total APC among persons aged 15+ years, with higher alcohol consumption among men than women."
"In 2019, alcohol consumption among men was four times that among women."
"The largest absolute sex-related inequalities in 2019 were evident in the European Region (difference of 10.9 percentage points between men and women), followed by the Region of the Americas (difference 8.7 percentage points), the Western Pacific Region (difference 7.2 percentage points), the African Region (difference 5.9 percentage points) and the South-East Asia Region (difference 5.1percentage points)."
Sex-related inequality did not change in the Region of the Americas (where inequality remained high) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (where there was no inequality).
"This section summarizes the global progress towards the reduction of hypertension; overweight and obesity are discussed in For the purpose of monitoring population health, hypertension is defined as having raised blood pressure4 or taking medication for hypertension."
"Globally, the age-standardized prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension declined slightly from 28.6% (UI: 28.029.3%) in 2010 to 26.2% (UI: 24.727.8%) in 2019, but this pace of decline is insufficient to achieve the global target Defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mm."
"Human health is dependent on a variety of environmental factors, such as safe WASH, clean air, safe chemical use, healthy built environments, sound agricultural practices, and protected natural areas and water sources."
"Since 2015, the number of people with basic hygiene services has increased by over 1billion."
"Access to safe WASH services improved significantly in rural areas between 2015 and 2022, but progress is limited in urban areas, when measured by the proportion of the population gaining services."
"However, because of population growth in urban areas, the number of people who have gained access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services since 2015 is higher in urban than in rural areas (Fig."
"Box 2.6	 Global sex-related inequalities in hypertension Globally, there are sex-related inequalities in age-standardized prevalence of hypertension among adults aged years."
"While there was no sex-related inequality in 1990 (prevalence of 32.4% [UI: 29.935.0] among men and 32.2% [UI: 29.734.9] among women), hypertension prevalence was slightly higher among men (34.5%; UI: Age-standardized coverage of treatment for hypertension among adults aged 3079 years with hypertension largely increased between 1990 and 2019, with the pace of increase slowing down slightly during the past decade, among both men and women."
"In contrast to hypertension prevalence, which was 2.8 percentage points higher among men than women in 2019, treatment prevalence was 9.3 percentage points higher among women Consequently, age-standardized prevalence of controlled hypertension among adults aged 3079 years with hypertension also increased between 1990 and 2019, with faster improvements among women than men, leading to an increase in sex-related absolute inequality over time."
"Since 2015, the global coverage of safely managed sanitation (SDG indicator 6.2.1) has increased from 49% to 57% in 2022, rising from 36% to 46% in rural areas and from 60% to 65% in urban areas."
"Overall coverage also remained largely unchanged in the African Region at 26%, as the gain in rural areas was offset by the decline in coverage in urban areas from 40% in 2015 to 36% in 2022."
"The proportion of total, domestic and industrial wastewater flows that are safely treated is monitored by SDG indicator 6.3.1."
"Wastewater statistics, however, are at an early stage of development in many countries and there is a lack of reporting, especially from industrial sources."
"In a separate calculation based on data from 140 countries and areas (representing 92% of all household wastewater flows), an estimated 58% of household wastewater was safely Many low- and middle-income countries lack domestic resources to improve the water sector."
"However, water sector ODA disbursements as a percentage of total ODA across all sectors decreased to 3.2% in 2022, a historical low, and continuing a downwards trend which has accelerated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 ."
"These trends show that while progress towards universal access to safe WASH has been made in some areas, there are still some gaps in data and service coverage."
"However, this means that 2.1billion people were still relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking in 2022, and the target of universal access by 2030 will not be met if current trends continue."
"Moreover, rural populations continued to have lower access than urban populations."
Particulate matter (PM) is a common proxy indicator for air pollution.
"In 2019, almost all (99%) of the worlds population was exposed to unhealthy levels of fine PM."
"However, it stood at around interim target 1 of the guidelines (35g/m3), and the five-year average level of (36g/m3) was 9% lower than that of (39g/m3), signalling improvement in outdoor air quality globally."
"The Region of the Americas and the European Region continued to have the lowest levels of fine PM since 2010 while simultaneously improving air quality over the years, thanks to regional cooperation and Addressing air pollution contributes significantly to safeguarding public health, promoting SDGs and mitigating climate change impacts."
"Box 2.7	 Urbanrural inequalities in access to clean fuels and technologies, globally and by WHO region, Globally, there are urbanrural inequalities in access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking, with higher access in urban than rural areas."
"However, this gap has been reducing continuously since 2000, due to a faster increase in access to clean cooking in rural than urban areas."
"While access to clean cooking was 51.5 percentage points higher among urban than rural areas in 2000, access in rural areas more than doubled between 2000 and 2022 (from 24.4% [UI: 20.529.8] in 2000 to 54.4% [UI: 49.358.7] in 2022), leading to a reduction in urbanrural inequality over time."
"Large absolute urbanrural inequalities occur in the African, Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia regions, where access was more than 30.0 percentage points higher in urban than in rural areas in 2022."
Elevated absolute inequalities with a difference of 20.0 percentage points or more between urban and rural areas were also present in the Region of the Americas and the Western Pacific Region.
"Small inequalities occur in the European Region (difference of 7.5 percentage points between urban and Access to clean cooking was above 50% in both urban and rural areas in all WHO regions in 2022, except the African Region, where coverage was below 50% in both urban (44.7%; UI: 40.649.1) and rural areas (8.2%; UI: 6.610.2)."
"The African Region was also the only region where absolute inequality has been increasing over time due to a faster increase in access to clean cooking in urban than rural areas (difference between urban and rural areas of 36.6 percentage points in 2022, up from 25.2 percentage points in 2000)."
"For example, an emphasis on womens reproductive roles, and potential or actual experience of physical, sexual and psychological violence, may prevent women and girls from fully accessing quality health services and attaining the best possible level of health."
"In many places, barriers to obtaining and using contraceptives prevent adolescents from avoiding In 2023, there were an estimated 12.7million births among teenage girls aged 1519 years, and almost half a million births among very young girls aged 1014 years, together representing 10% of all births worldwide."
"About one in six (16%) of all births in the WHO African Region, and about one in 10 (11%) in the Region of the Americas, was among adolescent mothers aged 1019 years in 2023 Adolescent birth rates (ABR) per 1000 girls (SDG indicator 3.7.2) have been falling since 2000, but the decrease has been slow and uneven."
"Among girls aged 1014years, the global ABR declined 2000, the European and Western Pacific regions have maintained the lowest ABR and the lowest proportion of births among adolescent girls out of all births, while the African Region continued to have the highest levels ."
Trend analyses based on data up to 2018 suggest that there has been insufficient progress in reducing IPV against women and girls over the past two decades .
"Emerging evidence also indicates that the prevalence of all forms of IPV is higher among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities (see section 4.2.3) (48, 49)."
"It acknowledges the importance of health systems strengthening based on a primary health care (PHC) approach, which is critical not just for centring people and communities, but also for effective health emergency prevention, preparedness, response and recovery, which has never been more salient than during UHC, grounded in the principle that all individuals and communities should have access to quality essential health services throughout the entire spectrum of care without enduring financial hardships, not only contributes to improving health outcomes (SDG 3) but also plays a pivotal role in other SDGs, including economic growth and job creation (SDG 8), gender equality (SDG 5), education (SDG 4), nutrition (SDG 2) and poverty reduction (SDG 1)."
Strengthening health systems and enhancing the sustainability and equity of health services and financing models are pivotal factors that contribute to the successful achievement of UHC.
Scaling up the coverage of essential health services with an emphasis Scaling up the coverage of effective essential health services is a fundamental strategy for achieving UHC.
It aims not only to improve health outcomes but also to promote health equity and ensure that health care is universally accessible and of high quality.

"Moreover, while there has been a positive increase in the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (SDG indicator 3.1.2), rising from 61% in 2000 to 86% in 2023 and notably improving outcomes in childbirth, it is important to acknowledge a slowdown in the pace of progress since 2015, and the global target of 90% coverage by 2025 is unlikely to be met unless progress is accelerated (55, 56)."
"Positive advancements have been observed in service coverage of NCDs, which continue to contribute the highest proportion of the disease burden."
The effective coverage for hypertension treatment is estimated to have more than doubled from 9% to 21% Data on treatment coverage for alcohol and drug use disorders between 2015 and 2018 range from extremely low (0.3%) to a maximum of 35% for drug use disorders and 14% for alcohol use disorders in the 20 countries that were able to report these data in 2019.
"To address challenges in estimating treatment coverage for substance use disorders (SDG indicator 3.5.1), a service capacity index has been introduced as a complementary measure (index range 0100)."
"The highest index values were observed in the European Region , while the lowest were in In most settings, efficiency and equity in the delivery of health services requires an increased emphasis on frontline services, particularly PHC."
"Increasing the recruitment, development, training and retention of Health workers are the cornerstone of a resilient health system, and the demand for health workers continues to increase as global health challenges become more complex and the worlds population grows and ages."

"Implementing the International Health Regulations (IHR) and service delivery models that promote resilience The ability to prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies is a critical component of UHC."
"Service delivery models that are truly fit for purpose need to be equipped to implement the IHR and to develop a clear sense of the types of threats they may face and to prepare The IHR States Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report (SPAR) tool consists of 35 indicators for the 15 IHR capacities needed to detect, assess, notify, report and respond to public health risks and acute events of domestic and international concern (SDG indicator 3.d.1)."
"Based on the analysis of the latest annual reporting data, the top challenges at the global level are policy, legal and normative instruments to implement IHR (C.1), chemical events (C.14), radiation emergencies (C.15) and human resources (C.6); while the top strengths are laboratory (C.4), surveillance (C.5), health emergency management (C.7) and health services provision (C8)."
"Box 2.8	 Towards stronger health security in the Pacific island countries Understanding the national capacities in health security in a regional and international context is especially important in regions that face distinctive health security challenges, such as the South Pacific."
"The South Pacific spans one third of the Earths surface, yet it is inhabited by less than 1% of the global population."
"The South Pacific is prone to extreme weather events, such as cyclones and flooding, which are increasing in intensity and frequency."
"One of the Pacific island countries with a complex set of challenges is Kiribati, which comprises 33 atolls scattered across the equator and over 5million square kilometres of water."
"In addition to infectious diseases, natural disasters such as the 2022 drought and the 2015 cyclone Pam have severely impacted Kiribatis health security."
"This has been the highest number of SPAR submissions in the region so far, shedding light on areas for improvement."
"Areas with the biggest gaps in the South Pacific, scoring on average less than 60 out of 100 points per area, are policy, legal and normative instruments to implement IHR; infection prevention and control (IPC); points of entry (Po."
The review process for completing the SPAR helped to map out where there were capacity gaps and opportunities for strengthening in coming years.

The largest shares were reported in the Western Pacific Region (19.8%) and South-East Asia Region (16.1%); the lowest shares were reported in the Region of the Americas (7.8%) and the European Region (7.9%) .
"Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and despite longstanding high-level commitments to health for all and UHC, progress was largely off-track."
Many governments have neglected foundational investments in health systems.
"Consequently, health services have been disrupted and inequities between and within countries have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Midway through the SDG period, there has been mixed progress in the health-related areas."
"Among the 53 health-related SDG indicators reviewed in this report, 32 have numeric SDG or other global targets."
"None of these targets has been achieved thus far, and none is likely to be met if current trends continue."
"However, most of the indicators (42 out of 53) are showing progress in the right direction globally; the remaining indicators are either moving in the wrong direction or cannot be assessed due to limited data."
"New and refocused commitment and capacities at national, regional and global levels are key to accelerate progress and reverse worrying trends."
"The WHO Triple Billion targets, outlined in and as the foundation of the WHO GPW13, are a set of ambitious goals aimed at improving global health by 2025: onebillion more people benefitting from UHC, onebillion more people better protected from health emergencies and onebillion more people enjoying better health and well-being (1, 2)."
"Functioning as both an impact measurement tool and a policy strategy, they are an integral part of the GPW13 Results Framework."
"They are tangible, related to human lives and able to"
Billion targets are based on 46 outcome indicators to track the progress that WHO and its Member States achieve in improving population health at the country level.
"The close alignment between the Triple Billion and SDGs enables countries to apply Triple Billion targets in delivering their Triple Billion projections were calculated for the years relative to a 2018 baseline, providing muchneeded milestones for progress made at the global, regional and country levels in providing, promoting and protecting global health."
"Overall, the world has collectively achieved the healthier populationbillion target, but is lagging on the other two billions."
"Relative to 2018, there was an estimated 1.2billion (UI: 0.91.4billion) more people enjoying better health and well-being in 2023; this will likely rise to more than 1.5billion (UI: 1.21.8billion) by 2025."
"In contrast, there was only 0.4billion (UI: 0.40.5billion) more people in 2023 benefitting from UHC, and only 0.6billion (0.50.7billion) better protected from health emergencies."
"The overall contribution of the UHC billion was disaggregated and the contribution of each underlying tracer indicator calculated, allowing for precise assessment of the impact of these individual indicators ."
"Overall, the world has been progressing steadily towards the HPOP billion target since 2018."
This target was achieved in 2023 with 1.2billion (UI: 0.91.4billion) more people enjoying better health and well-being compared with 2018.
"Although this trend was not reversed, progress slowed considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic."
The greatest improvement has been in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions.
"Compared with 2018, in 2023 there were 644million (UI: 536744million) and 318million (UI: 71503million) more people in these two regions, respectively, enjoying better health and well-being, accounting for 53.0% and 26.1% of the global total HPOP contribution, respectively ."
"HPOPbillion contribution by WHO region, Contribution (millions) Eastern Mediterranean Region Among the 21 tracer indicators included in the computation of the HPOPbillion, the three indicators with the greatest contributions are clean fuels, safely managed sanitation services and clean air (Fig."
"In 2019, the shares of these indicators in overall HPOP contribution were 27.1% (UI: 27.127.1%), 24.7% (UI: had the least contribution to HPOP was adult obesity: its contribution was 5.9% (UI: 6.6 to 5.2%) in 2019, and There was considerable heterogeneity in terms of contributions from tracer indicators across the WHO regions in 2023."
"The contribution of safely managed sanitation was greatest in the Region of the Americas (49.0%, UI: 45.652.1%) followed by the Western Pacific Region (44.4%, UI: 39.149.7%)."
"For clean air, the contribution was greatest in the European Region (52.2%, UI: 40.864.5%), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (31.4%, UI: 4.1 to 64.2%) and the Region of the Americas (28.9%, UI: 6.348.0%), but lowest in the African Region (0.1%, UI: 15.8 to 14.3%)."
"The contribution of safely managed water was prominent in the African Region, the Region of the Americas and the Eastern Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets"
"Obesity in adults made negative contribution across all six regions, which was largest in magnitude in the Region of the Americas (48.0%, UI: 58.0 to 36.9%), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean Region (26.0%, UI: 31.2 to 20.6%)."
"The impact of tobacco use among adults was salient across all six regions, especially in the European Region (27.7%, UI: 27.527.8%) and the Region of the Americas (24.6%, UI: 24.624.8%)."
"Changes in alcohol consumption also led to minor changes in the HPOPbillion, with the greatest impact found in the African Region (4.7%, UI: 12.7 to Contribution of tracer indicators to the HPOP billion, Clean fuel use Sanitation service - rural Other indicators below 1% of the total absolute contribution in 2030 Sanitation service - urban The UHCbillion is for improvement in the number of people having access to essential health services but without inflicting financial hardship."
"The calculation of progress towards the UHCbillion relied on the assessment of two components: average service coverage measured through 14 tracer indicators, and financial hardship measured through an indicator of catastrophic health spending, defined as the proportion of population whose household expenditure on health is greater than 10% of total household expenditure By 2023, there were only 429million more people benefitting from UHC without incurring catastrophic health spending compared with 2018, not even reaching half of the UHC billion target."
"The projection for 2025 is a mere 585million, suggesting that the world is seriously off the mark in achieving the UHCbillion target."
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic was salient, as the UHCbillion reduced or stalled in 2020 and 2021 before reversing the negative trend in 2022."
"The situation called for accelerated efforts and dramatic changes in public Among the six WHO regions, the Region of the Americas was the only region where the number of people benefitting from UHC decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared with 2018 (Fig."
"By 2023, catastrophic health spending made a negative contribution to the UHC billion globally (7.9%, UI: 8.0 to 7.8%); the magnitude was highest in the Western Pacific 11.6 to 11.4%) regions."
"However, the impact was minor."
Slight regression was also found in 2023 relative to 2018 with two other indicators density and DTP vaccination .
"The share of TB treatment was 8.6% (UI: 3.018.0%) globally, with the largest share in the South-East Asia Region (16.3%, UI: 7.423.5%)."
"The contribution of households using basic sanitation facilities was 10.4% (UI: 10.110.8%) globally, and highest in the Western Pacific Region (15.5%, UI: 14.716.3%)."
"The share of reduced prevalence in tobacco use among adults was 4.2% (UI: 4.14.3%) globally; this was largest in the Region of the Americas (15.0%, UI: 14.815.1%) and the European Region (10.2%, UI: Progress towards WHO Triple Billion targets"
"Contribution of tracer indicators to the UHC billion, HIV treatment Catastrophic health spending Other indicators below 1% of the total absolute contribution in 2030 The health emergencies protection (HEP) billion aims to have onebillion more people better protected from health emergencies."
"The index for thisbillion was calculated based on SDG 3 by measuring three indices: (i)emergency preparation, (ii)emergency prevention, and (iii)emergency detection and responses."
"At the global level, there has been consistent improvement in the HEPbillion since 2018 (Fig."
"However, such progress is still not sufficient to achieve the HEPbillion target by 2025."
"The improvement in the HEPbillion was relatively small in the Western Pacific, European and Eastern Mediterranean regions compared with other regions."
"The projected Triple Billion progress since 2019, the first year of the GPW13, showed that significant progress has been achieved for all three of the billions, particularly the HPOP billion as the world has likely already achieved the target of having onebillion more people living healthier lives by 2023 (Fig."
"However, such progress is far from sufficient to ensure the health-related SDG targets are Triple Billion projections based on current trends and an alternative scenario where hypothetical annualized rate of changes at the country level are applied such that each SDG indicator target is met by 2030 ."
"For such efforts, timely and accurate monitoring of the progress based on robust data is vital for effective policy changes and interventions."
It is evident that most indicators suffered from a data shortage at various degrees across countries.
"More often than not, the lack of data will not be limited to the data required by the Triple Billion; rather, it is deeply entrenched in poorly performing health information systems."
"Thus, efforts should be made to strengthen the general health information systems in countries to generate reliable data for the effective tracking of and policy changes regarding WHO is committed to work with Member States to strengthen their system capacity to collect, analyse and use health data."
Various tools have been developed by WHO to enhance countries data capacity.
"For example, the WHO SCORE for health data technical package was designed to assess the performance of national health information systems, identify the data gaps and provide a toolbox to improve various areas of a functioning health information system ."
The Data management competency framework (DMCF) developed by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is another example of such a tool; it enables health information managers to identify capacity gaps and drive competency development at various levels (Box 3.1).

Box 3.1	 Strategic and integrated capacity-building of the health information workforce in the Western Pacific Region Strategic use of data for decision-making is critical for measuring and driving progress towards global and national health indicator targets.
"This framework is a comprehensive, integrated and coherent tool that can be used to define and assess current and future competency needs of HIWs across the region and beyond."
Papua New Guinea has set out a clear path as the first country to adopt the framework.
"These competency profiles are invaluable as they provide a clear foundation for developing tools to assess training needs and formulating comprehensive, long-term capacity-building strategies."
The national data management competency profiles were officially launched together with the Provincial Health Authority Monitoring & Evaluation toolkit in .
"This ability to contextualize and apply the framework is essential, given the diverse nature of Member States health information systems and their diverse priorities and needs in addressing both present and future health challenges."
The WHO Triple Billion is a framework and a strategy aiming to drive timely improvement of global health.
"The targets, although set at the global level, were simply the aggregation of country-level estimates that were calculated based on underlying tracer indicators."
"The Triple Billion projections provide WHO, its Member States and partners with the much-needed assessment of progress towards fulfilling their commitment on Triple Billion targets and the health-related SDGs."
"Tracer indicators are the cornerstone of the Triple Billion targets, but also a critical tool for countries to identify and prioritize strategies to enhance the health of their populations."
"By examining the projected contributions at indicator level, policy-makers can make informed course adjustments to achieve the SDGs set by the As the GPW13 is drawing to a close in 2025, continuous tracking of the Triple."
"Billion targets and a proper transition from GPW13 to GPW14 is vital for WHO to ensure accountability, adaptability and efficiency in achieving the ambitious goals it set jointly with its Member States."
All three levels of WHO regional and country offices  should make every effort to align their priorities.
"The global population and economic growth, the advancement of science and technology, and the everincreasing interconnectedness of the world have brought about enormous societal changes along with unprecedented progress, but also multiple and complex challenges affecting the health of billions of people worldwide."
Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges.
It can lead to severe physical and cognitive damage that may last a lifetime.
A child who is moderately or severely wasted (due to recent rapid weight loss or a failure to gain weight) has an increased risk of death.
"In contrast, a child may be overweight due to excessive caloric intake, which may be due to poor access to nutritious foods, consumption of nutrient-poor ultra-processed foods and/or inadequate In childhood and adolescence, obesity is associated with greater risks and earlier onset of various NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease."
"In addition, children and teenagers living with obesity may experience psychosocial consequences from stigma, discrimination and bullying."
"In adults, obesity is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality from a variety of NCDs, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases and digestive disorders."
"Undernutrition in adults, as captured by the underweight indicator, is critical for adult women during pregnancy, with repercussions for both mother and child."
"In older adults, undernutrition can lead to increased risk of impaired immune response, and physical and cognitive impairment."
"Crude prevalence is used for children and adolescents aged 019 years, and age-standardized prevalence is used for adults aged 18 years and older."
"In 2022, an estimated 148million (UI: 144152million) children under 5years of age globally were affected by stunting (too short for age) and 45million (UI: 3654million) were affected by wasting (too thin for height), revealing the vast extent of undernutrition among the youngest population."
"However, an estimated 37million (UI: 3441million) children under 5years of age were In the same year, among older children and adolescents aged 519 years, an estimated 190million (UI: 180200million) were living with thinness, while 160million (UI: 150170million) were living with obesity."
"Among adults aged 20 years and older, an estimated 350million were underweight, while 880million were living with obesity."
"This means that over onebillion people aged 5years and older worldwide are living with obesity, while over half a billion others are living with underweight or These numbers, along with the health implications described above, indicate that the world is dealing with a public health problem not only at a massive scale but also 4.1.2	 Stunting, wasting and Undernutrition among children under 5years of age globally, as reflected by the number affected by stunting and wasting, has declined in the past three decades."
"At this pace of change, the world is off-track to meet the 2030 global targets to halve the number of children under 5years of age affected by stunting (from the 2012 baseline) and to reduce the prevalence of wasting and overweight to less than 3% (1, 3)."
Almost all WHO regions are experiencing a considerable burden of both undernutrition (in the form of stunting and wasting) and overweight among the youngest population.
This means that in 2022 almost one in five (18.5%) children in this region were either too thin or too heavy for their height.
"In addition, three out of 10 (30.1%, UI: 28.332.0%) children were affected by stunting, even though its prevalence had halved since 1990 when it stood at In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, approximately the same proportion of children were affected by wasting in 2022, while a quarter (25.1%, UI: 23.426.8%) of all children under 5years of age were affected by stunting."
"The Region of the Americas had the highest prevalence of overweight (8.5%, UI: 7.49.7%) across all WHO regions in 2022, and very low prevalence of wasting (0.8%, UI: children in this region were affected by stunting that year (Fig."
"Box 4.2	 A dramatic reduction in childhood stunting in Peru Since 2000, few countries have reduced the prevalence of stunting among children under 5 years of age as dramatically as Peru."
"It is estimated to have declined from a very high prevalence of 31.1% (UI: 29.432.8%) in 2000, to 10.1% (UI: 9.510.8%) in 2022, which is considered a medium prevalence."
"Thinness was dominant in the double burden of malnutrition in this age group in 1990, with a prevalence of 13.5% (UI: 12.914.2%) (compare obesity: 1.9%, UI: 1.82.1%)."
"This was driven by the rise in obesity, which tripled to 17.0% (UI: 15.618.3%) in 2022, while thinness prevalence decreased only slightly from 2.9% (UI: 2.53.5%) to 2.1% (UI: 1.92.4%)."
"The South-East Asia Region was the only region where the double burden decreased, as thinness prevalence fell sharply from 29.9% region continued to have the highest thinness prevalence while obesity prevalence increased at an alarming rate Prevalence of thinness and overweight among children and adolescents aged 519 years, globally and by WHO region, Prevalence (%) Eastern Mediterranean Region Prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents aged 519 years Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents aged 519 years Source: NCD Risk Factor Collaboration ."
"In 1990, globally an estimated 490million (UI: 470500million) adults aged 18 years and older were living with underweight, while 200million (UI: 190200million) were living with obesity."
"This increase has been driven by the rise in obesity, the age-standardized prevalence of which more than doubled from 6.6% (UI: 6.46.8%) in 1990 to 15.8% (UI: 15.416.2%) in 2022."
"The age-standardized prevalence of underweight halved in the same period, from 14.5% (UI: means that obesity has taken over the dominance in the double burden of malnutrition among adults globally in the past three decades (Fig."
"The Region of the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean Region have experienced the largest absolute increase in obesity prevalence since 1990, leading to the highest obesity prevalence across WHO regions in 2022, affecting one third of adults in the Region of the Americas and almost three in 10 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region."
"In the European Region, the 8.9 percentage point increase in the double burden was due entirely to the rise in obesity prevalence, as thinness prevalence remained low."
"About half of the double burden in the African Region was due to obesity in 2022, up from about one fifth in 1990."
"The Western Pacific Region remained the region with the lowest combined prevalence of underweight and obesity among adults, but obesity is becoming dominant."
"In 2022, obesity prevalence among women was a third or 4.3 percentage points higher among women Different patterns are observed across the six WHO regions."
"These doubleduty actions are evidence-based, efficient and effective interventions that can make the most of often limited time, fiscal and human resources."
"Common delivery platforms that can be leveraged for double-duty actions include national dietary guidelines, health systems, urban food systems, humanitarian settings and social Double-duty actions need not necessarily be new actions."
"Rather, policy-makers can capitalize on existing government buy-in and resources, by reviewing and refocusing existing food and agriculture policies."
Strong opportunities for double-duty actions include the following examples: school feeding programmes that focus only on addressing undernutrition or overweight can be redesigned to ensure that they instead provide and promote a healthy diet; scaling up the WHO antenatal care recommendations; protecting and promoting breastfeeding; revising complementary feeding guidelines and educating care-givers on the risks of unhealthy complementary foods; designing social support and welfare programmes to reduce risks from unhealthy foods; and ensuring that food systems and food environment policies facilitate the purchase and consumption of a healthy diet by increasing access to and attractiveness of nutritious foods.
Nutrition and food safety are closely interlinked and essential for achieving positive health outcomes from food systems.
"There is a linkage between sub infection with enteropathogens and stunting (8, 9)."
"This understanding of disability is grounded in the WHO International classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF), published in According to the WHO Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities, approximately 1.3billion persons in 2021  about 16% of the global population  had disability."
The global number of persons with disabilities has increased substantially in the past decade due to demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and the increase in the number of persons with NCDs who are living longer and ageing with limitations in functioning .
"They die younger, have poorer health and increased disease risk, and more limitations in their everyday functioning."
"The contributing factors to these inequities can be (i) health-system-related factors, such as barriers in physical infrastructure and communication, negative attitudes by health workers or lack of disability data in the health information system; (ii) structural factors, such as stigma and discrimination; (iii) social determinants, such as poverty and lack of education; and (iv) disease risk factors such as tobacco consumption and obesity."
"However, a growing body of evidence indicates that persons with disabilities have higher rates of premature mortality compared with persons without disabilities ."
A systematic review of 70 studies from 22 low- and middleincome countries found that persons with disabilities have double the mortality rates of persons without disabilities .
Premature mortality is even more visible in those that are most marginalized among persons with disabilities.
"For example, evidence from some high-income European countries shows that persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities have higher risks of premature mortality compared with the general population ."
A systematic review of 56 studies found that persons with disabilities were almost three times as likely to die from COVID-19 than persons without Persons with disabilities have in general poorer health and higher risk of developing secondary health conditions .
"Data from across 31 European countries collected via the European Health Interview Survey in show that, overall, compared with persons without disability, persons with severe disability are more likely to report having NCDs, including chronic respiratory diseases (over eight times as likely), coronary heart disease or angina pectoris (12 times as likely); stroke (28 times as likely); diabetes (almost six times as likely); and depression (over eight times as likely)."

Difference is the difference between the median estimate values for persons with severe disability and persons with no disability.
Ratio is the ratio between the median estimate values for persons with severe disability and persons with no disability.
The indicators are based on self-reported chronic conditions or risk factors in 12months prior to the survey.
A systematic review of 29 studies from eight high-income countries found that women with disabilities are 22% less likely to have been screened for breast cancer and 33% less likely to have been screened for cervical cancer than their non-disabled peers .
"Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 28 countries show that children with disabilities are generally at greater risk of missing out on vaccinations: only 44% of children aged 2435months with more than one functional difficulty are fully vaccinated, compared with 58% of children at the same age without Evidence from 37 countries shows that persons with disabilities have lower access to health services than those without disabilities (Fig."
"Across these countries, the median estimate shows that persons with disabilities are more than four times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it: 9% of persons with disabilities versus 2% of persons without disabilities indicated that they needed but could not get health care."
"In eight countries, more than 20% of persons with disabilities were not able to get health care when they needed it (21, 22)."
"In European countries, costs of services, geographical location and long waiting lists, which disproportionately affect persons with disabilities, are major factors in the lower access to health services."
"Beyond health-system factors, persons with disabilities are also more likely to have risk factors for ill health."
"Data from 31 European countries show that, compared with persons without disabilities, persons with severe disabilities are overall three times as likely to self-report having high blood pressure, twice as likely to be obese and a third as likely to do regular aerobic physical activity (Fig."
"Very often, the reason for the higher risk factor presence in persons with disabilities is the lack of accessible health promotion and prevention strategies, which do not allow this population to benefit equally ."
Poverty is a solid example to demonstrate this.
"Across European countries, 77.7% of persons with severe disabilities were at risk of poverty before social transfers (such as benefits, allowances and pensions), compared with 35.2% of persons with no disability."
"Yet even after social transfers, poverty risk is still double among persons with disabilities (24.4%, compared with 13.4%) (Fig."
"In nine countries, there was little or no disability-related inequity in poverty risk (5percentage points difference), yet in the remaining countries the gap ranged up to 35.7 percentage points (18, 21)."

"According to the analysis from 36 European countries, persons with severe disability are overall twice as likely to report having unmet health-care needs due to financial limitations than persons with no disability."
They are also almost twice as likely to be unable to meet unexpected financial expenses (e.g.
"Gaps in formal social support mechanisms may mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on family members for support to engage in health activities and support for their mental health; yet the proportion of persons who felt they had strong social support was overall 10percentage points lower among persons with severe disabilities (18, 21)."
"Evidence also suggests that, compared with persons without disabilities, persons with disabilities are at greater risk of violence, including IPV,1 but significant data gaps remain."
"Inequality in health determinants between persons with severe disability and persons with no disability across 36 European countries, Indicator People at risk of poverty before social transfers (%) People at risk of poverty (%) Self-reported unmet needs for health care for Inability to face unexpected financial expenses (%) Housing cost overburden rate (%) Severe material deprivation (%) Overall perceived strong social support (%) Notes: circles indicate countries  each country is represented by multiple circles (one for each indicator and each subgroup)."
Difference is the difference between the median estimate values for persons with severe disability and persons with no disability.
Ratio is the ratio between the median estimate values for persons with severe disability and persons with no disability.
"Box 4.4	 Intimate partner violence against women with disabilities A systematic review of 26 studies, mainly from high-income countries, concluded that the prevalence of all forms of IPV (including physical, psychological/emotional, sexual and financial) was higher among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities ."
Evidence is also emerging from low- and middle-income countries.
"For example, analysis of data from seven violence-prevention programmes in low- and middle-income countries indicated that women with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to report past-12-month IPV than women without disabilities ."
"Current estimates are likely significant underestimates, as women with disabilities tend to be underrepresented in surveys and may also experience disability-specific types of violence that are often unmeasured."
"For a better understanding of the risk factors for violence against women, and to enable the development of more specialized prevention strategies and response plans, it is necessary to improve the inclusion of women with disabilities and the issue of disability within violence against women in population-based surveys and research."
It is essential that the actions that governments take to advance disability inclusion in the health sector are informed by valid and reliable data that allow monitoring and tracking progress.
"As shown above, however, data on health inequities among persons with disabilities are scarce."
"Factors contributing to the inequity are frequently not well captured, making it difficult sometimes to explore the drivers of the differences and whether these differences are indeed due to unjust or unfair factors."
The collection of data on disability is often deprioritized in many countries; consequently the evidence of health inequities and their contributing factors is more limited than for other groups in marginalized situations.
"However, lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of inequities."
"There is a fundamental need to collect or disaggregate population- and facility-based data based on disability status, across the different levels of country health information systems."
"For example, at input level, administrative sources such as financial tracking systems, databases and records on human resources, infrastructure or policies can be used to understand how financing for disability works, or whether health facilities are accessible."
"At output level, facility assessments or facility reporting systems can measure availability of services, service readiness or quality."
"At outcome and impact level, disability-specific surveys or routine health and demographic surveys that allow disaggregation of data by disability, and integrating disability indicators in facility-level data collection can facilitate in-depth understanding of the experiences of persons with disabilities in terms of health-care needs and coverage."
Chile is among the countries that have implemented the WHO Model Disability Survey to inform policy (Box 4.5).
"Only through valid and reliable data on disability will countries be able to develop evidenced-based policies to monitor the SDGs, to measure progress towards national targets such as UHC and to take stock of the challenges World health statistics 2024: monitoring health for the SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals"
"WHO has been supporting the successful implementation of the MDS in more than 15 countries to date, providing a comprehensive assessment of the situation of persons with disabilities, and contributing to better public policy."
"For example, Law 21.015 on labour inclusion was implemented, setting a labour quota of 1% for workers with disabilities that all companies with more than 100 workers must meet  with plans dedicated to gradually increase this percentage."
"Furthermore, the results of the study helped design protocols and methodologies to improve the level of participation of persons with disabilities, such as the 2017 national census that incorporated a protocol to interview persons with disabilities in their homes."
"In addition, the development of the National Mental Health Action Plan, which was launched in 2017, and the National Disability Qualification and Certification Plan."
More actions were taken towards improving access to health services among persons with disabilities.
"In addition, a decision was taken to include disability questions in the countrys National Health Survey to enable the government to better track progress and understand unmet service needs among persons with disabilities."
"The results of the new assessment will help the Government of Chile better understand the impact of disabilityrelated policies and actions that the country has taken, and plan next steps towards addressing the needs of persons with disabilities and to monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons The number of international migrants increased from 153million (2.9% of the global population) in 1990 to 281million (3.6% of the global population) in 2020 ."
"This number does not include internal migrants, which were estimated to be around 763million in 2005 ."
"In addition, in mid-2023, an estimated 110million people were forcibly displaced, including those who are internally displaced, refugees and asylum seekers ."
Migration could either improve or degrade an individuals health status.
"Prioritizing the rights of refugees and migrants to timely, affordable and dignified health care is essential for achieving health equity."
New and renewed emergencies are straining health services in all WHO regions.
"In addition to deaths and injuries, the risks of infectious diseases and mental health conditions also increase; meanwhile health facilities may be unable to cope as they are heavily affected by power and supply outages, or even targeted in conflicts."
"The threat of malnutrition and starvation exists further down the line as a result of disrupted food supplies, exacerbating critical health needs of already vulnerable Although a large proportion of refugees and migrants are in generally good health, their numbers also include children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and those whose health has been negatively impacted by their travels or the circumstances in their home country."
"These health needs transcend national boundaries, but many countries restrict health coverage based on immigration status, limiting access to health insurance and services, and the cost of non-emergency care may be an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense."
"These factors leave millions in vulnerable situations globally, and they may encounter poorer health outcomes, particularly in substandard living and working For instance, studies have found higher rates of anaemia in women and children among refugees and migrants compared with local populations, and there is an increased risk of both anaemia and malnutrition in some camp-based settings ."
"Migrant workers may face discrimination, exploitation, limited workplace rights and social protection, as well as significant occupational health problems, such as higher risk of occupational injuries documented particularly among male migrant workers employed in high-risk industries ."
Those who were employed in essential sectors such as health care and agriculture bore a disproportionate burden of pandemic-related challenges .
"In addition, refugees and migrants may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR during various phases of migration and displacement, due to factors such as exposure to infections, limited access to diagnostics and therapeutics and inappropriate use of Distribution of access to government health services for refugees and migrants across 84 countries, Access to all services emergency healthcare services only Proportion of countries (%) Source: WHO , based on unpublished data from the International Organization for Migration."
"Yet, data on health-care access policies from 84 countries between 2018 and 2021 show that only half of them provide refugees and migrants with access to all government-funded health services under the same conditions as nationals, regardless of migratory status Available evidence reveals mixed patterns of NCD burden and risks among migrants and refugees compared with host populations."
"Taking cancer as an example, studies from three high-income countries in the Americas suggested better outcomes for migrants with cancer, whereas research from two high-income European countries indicated that cancer was often diagnosed at advanced stages among refugee and migrant populations, leading to poorer health outcomes than host populations ."
"These challenges are mirrored in other regions, with refugee and migrant women facing barriers to HPV vaccination in settings where factors such as accessibility and physician recommendations play significant roles (60, 61)."
"Overall, 18% of non-migrants were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, compared with 29% of migrants."
"Migrants were also 1.7 times as likely to have material and social deprivation (defined as not being able to afford certain goods, services and social activities), twice as likely to be overburdened by housing costs as a portion of their income and 2.6 times as likely to be living in overcrowded conditions."
They were also less likely (0.8 times) to have social support.
"However, there was little difference overall between migrants and nonmigrants in terms of unmet needs for medical examination, though this varied across countries (18, 21)."
"European countries, Indicator People at risk of poverty or social exclusion (%) Children at risk of poverty (%) Self-reported unmet needs for medical examination because too expensive, too far to travel or Material and social deprivation rate (%) Housing cost overburden rate (%) Overall perceived strong social support (%) Notes: circles indicate countries  each country is represented by multiple circles (one for each indicator and each subgroup)."
Difference is the difference between the median estimate values for people with severe disability and people with no disability.
Ratio is the ratio between the median estimate values for migrants and non-migrants.
"European countries, National average (%) -Dierence between migrants and non-migrants (percentage points) People having a long-standing illness or health problem (%) -Dierence between migrants and non-migrants (percentage points) People with high blood pressure (%) -Dierence between migrants and non-migrants (percentage points) People who are overweight (body mass index [BMI] equal to or greater than 25) (%) -Dierence between migrants and non-migrants (percentage points) Daily smoking of tobacco products (%) Notes: circles indicate countries  each country is represented by multiple circles (one for each indicator)."
The indicators are based on self-reported chronic conditions or risk factors in the 12 months prior to the survey.
"For example, the proportion of people reporting a long-standing illness or health problem is more than 10percentage points higher among migrants compared with non-migrants in seven countries, but is more than 10percentage points higher among non-migrants in six other countries."
"Reported high blood pressure prevalence is more than 10percentage points higher among migrant populations in three countries, but is more than 10percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in seven other countries (18, 21)."
"For example, the prevalence of tobacco smoking was over 5percentage points higher among migrants in four countries, but over 5percentage points higher among non-migrants in six countries."
"In eight countries, reported overweight prevalence was at least 5percentage points higher among migrant populations, while it was also at least 5percentage points higher among non-migrant populations in eight countries (18, 21)."
"This makes it challenging to understand and address their health needs, develop inclusive public health approaches and track progress towards national and global health goals."
Data-driven approaches are vital for fostering health equity and social inclusion.
"Since the Global Action Plan is founded on health issues for refugees and migrants, such data and the resulting monitoring will also contribute to the health-related SDGs for the population on the move, in particular refugees and migrants worldwide."
"In response to the urgent need for evidence on the health status and needs of refugees, Statistics Poland collaborated closely with WHO at country, regional and approach was adopted in the border provinces of Poland, through a representative household survey and behavioural insights research, initiated in 2022, and repeated in 2023."
The results are illustrated in Fig.
"Even though services were rapidly made available for them, the European Union directive that allowed such provision does not necessarily address barriers to access, and hence barriers such as language and cultural differences and lack of information hindered and continue to hinder health-care access."
"Mental health illness, though prevalent, was often underreported due to stigma and practical obstacles."
Data showed that the percentage of refugees spending more than 25% of their income or savings on health care in 2023 was almost half that in 2022 (Fig.
