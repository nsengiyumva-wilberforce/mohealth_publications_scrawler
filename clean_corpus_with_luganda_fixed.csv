H DPNM has implemented several strategies to promote last mile assurance.,H DPNM etadde mu nkola enkola eziwerako okutumbula okukakasa mayiro ezisembayo.
"Health Commodity Accountability including the National Malaria Control Division (NMCD), AIDS Control Program (ACP), and the Reproductive and Infant (R&I) and the NMS Client Self Services Portal (CSSP) to establish the extent to which health facilities are accounting for health commodities.","Obuvunaanyizibwa bw’ebintu eby’obulamu omuli ekitongole ekivunaanyizibwa ku kulwanyisa omusujja gw’ensiri mu ggwanga (NMCD), AIDS Control Programme (ACP), n’ekitongole ekizaala n’abaana abawere (R&I) ne NMS Client Self Services Portal (CSSP) okuteekawo ekigero ebifo by’ebyobulamu we bibeera okubala ebintu by’ebyobulamu."
"For malaria Commodities, morbidity and diagnosis data from DHIS2 was compared with malaria commodity supply data from NMS to health facilities for FY 2022/2023.","Ku bintu ebikozesebwa mu musujja, ebikwata ku bulwadde n’okuzuula obulwadde okuva mu DHIS2 byageraageranyizibwa ku biwandiiko by’omusujja gw’ensiri okuva mu NMS okutuuka mu bifo by’ebyobulamu eby’omwaka gw’ebyensimbi 2022/2023."
"For Family Planning, HIV, and Laboratory commodities; expected stock on hand (SOH) estimated as opening balance plus quantity received plus adjustments, less consumption data and losses, was compared with reported closing balance (COB) for each of the cycles one () to five ().","ku nteekateeka y’amaka, akawuka ka siriimu, n’ebintu ebikozesebwa mu laboratory; Sitooki esuubirwa ku mukono (SOH) ebalirirwa nga bbalansi y’okuggulawo nga kwogasse n’ennongoosereza ezifunibwa nga kwogasse n’ennongoosereza, ebitono ebikwata ku kukozesa n’okufiirwa, yageraageranyizibwa ku bbalansi y’okuggalawo eyaloopebwa (COB) ku buli emu ku nsengekera emu () okutuuka ku ttaano ()."
The potentially unaccounted for commodities/funds for each health facility were aggregated to estimate the total volume/value for each of the 136 districts.,Ebiyinza okuba nga tebibalirirwamu bikozesebwa/ensimbi ku buli kifo ky’ebyobulamu byagattibwa wamu okubalirira omuwendo/omuwendo gwonna ku buli emu ku disitulikiti 136.
Data for the 10 cities was considered under each of the parent districts.,Ebiwandiiko by’ebibuga 10 byalowoozebwako wansi wa buli emu ku disitulikiti ezizadde.
"Although positions for HC4, resource structure, many districts have been reluctant to recruit for these roles, citing inadequate funding.","Wadde nga ebifo bya HC4, ensengeka y’ebintu, disitulikiti nnyingi zibadde teziyagala kuyingiza mirimu gino, nga zijuliza ensimbi ezitamala."
"This has likely contributed to accountability challenges for health commodities, as one of the key responsibilities of a health facility or district Pharmacist is to ensure proper accountability 3.1.4.2.","Kino kirabika kivuddeko okusoomoozebwa kw’obuvunaanyizibwa ku bintu eby’obulamu, kubanga ekimu ku bikulu obuvunaanyizibwa bw’ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu oba omusawo w’eddagala mu disitulikiti kwe kulaba ng’obuvunaanyizibwa buvunaanyizibwa 3.1.4.2."
"Accountability was tracked using stock cards, requisition and issue vouchers, as well as dispensing and laboratory registers.","Obuvunaanyizibwa bwalondoolebwa nga bakozesa kaadi za sitooka, requisition ne issue vouchers, wamu ne dispensing ne laboratory registers."
"However, the highest discrepancies were observed in combined cycle deliveries.","Naye, obutakwatagana obusinga obunene bwalabiddwa mu kuzaala enzirukanya ezigatta."
"To address this, NMS combined distribution cycles to align with the Although health facilities are using accountability tools, challenges persist at dispensing units, where some facilities struggle to complete daily and monthly summaries of dispensed medicines and health supplies.","Okusobola okukola ku kino, NMS okugatta enzirukanya y’okugaba okukwatagana n’ebifo eby’obulamu wadde nga bakozesa ebikozesebwa mu buvunaanyizibwa, okusoomoozebwa kukyaliwo mu bifo ebigaba ebintu, ng’ebifo ebimu birwana okumaliriza mu bufunze buli lunaku n’omwezi eby’eddagala eriweebwa n’ebikozesebwa mu bulamu."
"To improve facility performance, a multipronged approach is needed, including on-site training, mentorship, intensified supervision by District Health Teams, self-audits by health facility staff, and involvement of Local Government Leaders in reconciliation and accountability efforts.","Okulongoosa enkola y’ebifo, enkola ey’emitendera mingi yeetaagibwa, omuli okutendekebwa mu kifo, okubuulirira, okulabirira okw’amaanyi ttiimu z’ebyobulamu mu disitulikiti, okwebala abasomesa abakozi b’ekifo ky’ebyobulamu, n’okwenyigira kw’abakulembeze ba gavumenti z’ebitundu mu kaweefube w’okutabaganya n’okuvunaanyizibwa."
"Additionally, the rollout of Electronic Logistics Management Information Systems (e. LMIS) should be fast-tracked and prioritized to enhance accountability and tracking of health commodities.","Okugatta ku ekyo, okutandikawo enkola z’amawulire agakwata ku kuddukanya emirimu mu byuma bikalimagezi (E. LMIS) kulina okugobererwa amangu era ne kukulembeza okutumbula obuvunaanyizibwa n’okulondoola ebintu eby’obulamu."
An in-depth spot-check assessment was done for reproductive health commodities.,Okukebera mu bujjuvu okukebera ekifo kyakolebwa ku bintu eby’obulamu eby’okuzaala.
"The value of sampled health commodities delivered was $.08, which is equivalent to 90% of the total value of UNFPA programme supplies delivered to the Mo.","Omuwendo gw’ebintu eby’obulamu ebyaweebwa sampuli gwali $.08, nga kino kyenkanawa ne 90% ku muwendo gwonna ogw’ebintu bya pulogulaamu ya UNFPA ebituusibwa eri MO."
NMS and JMS warehouses were adequately equipped and maintained the storage of health supplies.,Sitoowa za NMS ne JMS zaali zirina ebikozesebwa ebimala era nga zikuuma okutereka ebintu eby’obulamu.
"However, the storage infrastructure at 7 out of 12 sampled Service Delivery Points (SDPs) was not in good condition due to budgetary constraints which inhibited regular maintenance and purchase of store equipment.","Wabula, enkola y’okutereka ku 7 ku 12 sampled service points points (SDPs) teyali mu mbeera nnungi olw’obuzibu bw’embalirira eyaziyiza okuddaabiriza buli kiseera n’okugula ebyuma bya sitoowa."
Eleven  out of the 14 sampled facilities had maintained inventory records and the supplies received were recorded in stock cards.,Ebifo 11 ku 14 ebyakwatibwa sampuli byali bikuumye ebiwandiiko by’ebintu era ebikozesebwa ebyafunibwa byawandiikibwa mu sitoowa.
Syringes 1ml were observed to be overstocked at seven  health facilities because Depo Provera was issued without the syringes during interfacility transfers.,Empiso 1ml zaalabiddwa nga zisusse mu bifo by’ebyobulamu musanvu kubanga DEPO Provera yafulumizibwa nga tewali mpiso mu kiseera ky’okukyusa enkolagana.
"Jadelle, Implanon NXT and Depo Provera were found to be overstocked across 3 out of 12 service delivery points (SDPs).","Jadelle, Implanon NXT ne DEPO Provera zaasangiddwa nga zisukkiridde okubeera nga zikoleddwa mu bifo 3 ku 12 eby’okugaba obuweereza (SDPs)."
"Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report Health Commodity Ordering and reporting Health facilities place routine orders for health commodities based on a defined annual ordering schedule, which is developed and disseminated by NMS and JMS to the public and PNFP/PFP health facilities respectively.","Eddagala eriweebwa buli mwaka Lipoota y’emirimu gy’ebyobulamu Okulagira n’okukola lipoota Ebifo by’ebyobulamu biteeka ebiragiro ebya bulijjo ku bintu eby’obulamu nga byesigamiziddwa ku nteekateeka y’okulagira buli mwaka etegeerekese, ekolebwa era n’esaasaanyizibwa NMS ne JMS eri abantu bonna n’ebifo by’ebyobulamu ebya PNFP/PFP."
H approved order and report templates and systems are used to place orders.,H Ebipande n’enkola ezikkirizibwa n’enkola ezikkirizibwa zikozesebwa okuteeka ebiragiro.
"To address this challenge, the warehouse-integrated ordering system was introduced, extending the warehouse Enterprise Resource Platform (ERP) to include the client service portal.","Okusobola okukola ku kusoomoozebwa kuno, enkola y’okulagira ey’okugatta mu sitoowa yayanjulwa, n’egaziya ku nkola ya Warehouse Enterprise Resource Platform (ERP) okussaamu omukutu gw’okuweereza bakasitoma."
Late orders are automatically locked out unless an extension is formally authorized.,Ebiragiro ebikeerezi biggalwa mu ngeri ey’otoma okuggyako ng’okwongezaayo kukkiriziddwa mu butongole.
"Each health facility is required to order specific health commodity categories based on its accreditation and service level, following the one facility, one warehouse policy, as per the ordering schedule developed and shared by the warehouse.","Buli kifo ky’ebyobulamu kyetaagibwa okulagira ebika by’ebintu eby’obulamu ebitongole okusinziira ku mutendera gwakyo ogw’okukkiriza n’obuweereza, nga kigoberera ekifo kimu, enkola emu ey’omu sitoowa, nga bwe kiri mu nteekateeka y’okulagira eyakolebwa era n’egabana sitoowa."
"These categories include Essential Medicines and Health Supplies (EMHS, commonly referred to as the credit line), HIV Test Kits, Laboratory supplies, Tuberculosis (TB) medicines, Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) TB medicines, and Reproductive Health To ensure that all required orders from a health facility are placed within a particular order cycle, tracking is based on the different commodity categories.","Ebika bino mulimu eddagala ery’omugaso n’ebikozesebwa mu bulamu (EMHS, ebitera okuyitibwa ebbanja ly’ebbanja), ebikozesebwa mu kukebera akawuka ka siriimu, ebikozesebwa mu laboratory, eddagala ly’akafuba (TB), eddagala eriziyiza eddagala eringi (MDR) TB, n’obulamu bw’okuzaala okukakasa nti ebiragiro byonna ebyetaagisa okuva mu kifo ky’ebyobulamu biteekebwa mu nsengekera y’ebiragiro entongole, okulondoola kwesigamiziddwa ku bitundu by’ebintu eby’enjawulo."
Order rate performance is measured by the timely submission of complete order sets.,Omulimu gw’omutindo gw’okulagira gupimibwa nga guweereddwayo mu budde ensengekera z’okulagira ezijjuvu.
"As such, ordering rate performance is defined as the number of facilities that submitted the expected complete order sets within each order cycle.","Nga bwe kiri, omulimu gw’okulagira gunnyonnyolwa ng’omuwendo gw’ebikozesebwa ebyawaayo ebisuubirwa mu ndagiriro enzijuvu mu buli mutendera gw’okulagira."
"Public health facilities commodity ordering using NMS+ CSSP National Medical Stores is mandated to procure, store and distribute EMHS to all public health facilities within the country, including Army, Police and Prisons health facilities.","Ebifo by’ebyobulamu eby’olukale Okulagira nga tukozesa NMS+ CSSP National Medical Stores kiweereddwa obuyinza okugula, okutereka n’okusaasaanya EMHS mu bifo byonna eby’obulamu mu ggwanga, omuli amagye, poliisi n’ebifo eby’obulamu eby’amakomera."
"NMS serves over public health facilities at various levels of care, with over  being Health Center IIIs and above, while the rest are Health Center IIs.","NMS eweereza ku bifo by’ebyobulamu eby’olukale ku mitendera egy’enjawulo egy’okulabirira, nga over being health centre IIISs n’okudda waggulu, ate ebisigadde ye Health Center IIS."
The average ordering rate using NMS+ CSSP for both lower and higher-level public health facilities has been sustained at >95% in FY 2023/24 for program and nonprogram commodities across the six order cycles as shown in,Omuwendo gwa wakati ogw’okugula nga tukozesa NMS+ CSSP ku bifo byombi eby’ebyobulamu ebya wansi n’eby’omutindo ogwa waggulu bibaddewo ku >95% mu mwaka gw’ebyensimbi 2023/24 ku bintu bya pulogulaamu n’ebitali bya pulogulaamu mu mitendera omukaaga egy’okulagira nga bwe kiragibwa mu

H Digital Health Architecture Principles Architecture principles are a set of principles that relate to architectural work.,H Digital Health Architecture Principles Emisingi gy’okuzimba emisingi egy’enjawulo egyekuusa ku mulimu gw’okuzimba.
They are not only expected to act as drivers for defining functional requirements for the architecture but will also be used as a guide when assessing Digital Health innovations.,Tezisuubirwa kukola nga ddereeva okunnyonnyola ebyetaago by’emirimu ku nzimba wabula era zijja kukozesebwa ng’omulagirizi nga twekenneenya obuyiiya bw’ebyobulamu mu ngeri ya digito.
"Each principle has a code, statement, rationale, and implication.","Buli musingi gulina koodi, ekigambo, ensonga enkulu, n’ekitegeeza."
"Therefore, an inclusive and participatory development approach is required to address the collective","N’olwekyo, enkola ey’okukulaakulanya abantu bonna era eyeetabye mu"

"When making decisions to create a new Digital Health capability, stakeholders must consider the total cost of developing and maintaining the Digital Health solution Digital Health solutions should be acquired or developed, deployed, replaced and decommissioned at the least cost while ensuring fitness for purpose of an overall system Operational procedures and their likely cost must be identified early in selecting and developing a Digital Health solution","Nga basalawo okukola obusobozi obupya obw’ebyobulamu obwa digito, abakwatibwako balina okulowooza ku muwendo gwonna ogw’okukola n’okulabirira eby’obulamu ebya digito eby’okugonjoola eby’obulamu eby’omulembe eby’obulamu ebya digito birina okufunibwa oba okukolebwa, okuteekebwa mu nkola, okukyusibwa n’okuggyibwawo waakiri ssente nga bwe bikakasa nti bituukagana n’ekigendererwa ky’enkola y’emirimu okutwalira awamu n’omuwendo gwazo gulina okuzuulibwa nga bukyali mu kulonda n’okukola eky’okugonjoola ebyobulamu mu ngeri ya digito"
Periodic reviews of the Digital Health solutions should be carried out to assure healthcare continuity.,Okuddamu okwetegereza buli luvannyuma lwa kiseera eby’okugonjoola ebizibu by’ebyobulamu ebya digito kulina okukolebwa okukakasa okugenda mu maaso kw’ebyobulamu.
"Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability should be addressed at the design time.","Okuzzaawo, okukendeeza, n’okulabirira birina okukolebwako mu kiseera ky’okukola dizayini."
All Digital Health solutions that are critical in healthcare delivery must be assessed to determine what level of continuity is required and the necessary recovery plan.,Ebizibu byonna eby’obulamu ebya digito ebikulu mu kugaba ebyobulamu birina okwekenneenya okuzuula omutendera ki ogw’okugenda mu maaso ogwetaagisa n’enteekateeka eyeetaagisa ey’okudda engulu.
Health organisations shall not be allowed to develop Digital Health solutions that are similar/duplicative to health sector-wide solutions.,Ebibiina by’ebyobulamu tebirina kukkirizibwa kukola bya bulamu bya digito ebifaanagana/eby’okuddiŋŋana n’okugonjoola ebizibu by’ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu kyonna.
"Comply with Laws, Policies, and Regulations Digital Health solutions and infrastructure should comply with applicable legislation and policies in all jurisdictions and organisations within which they operate Digital Health systems should comply with all applicable legislation, regulation, and standards.","Okugoberera amateeka, enkola, n’ebiragiro eby’okugonjoola ebyobulamu mu ngeri ya digito n’ebikozesebwa birina okugoberera amateeka n’enkola ezikola mu bitundu byonna n’ebibiina mwe bikolera enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito birina okugoberera amateeka gonna agakola, amateeka, n’omutindo."

"These requirements should be kept up to date to reflect changes in legislation and policy Digital Health developers and implementers must be compliant with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the collection, retention, management and dissemination of health","Ebisaanyizo bino birina okukuumibwa nga bituukagana n’enkyukakyuka mu mateeka n’enkola abakola ebyobulamu mu ngeri ya digito n’abassa mu nkola balina okugoberera amateeka, ebiragiro, n’enkola ez’ebweru ezikwata ku kukungaanya, okukuuma, okuddukanya n’okubunyisa ebyobulamu ."
"The National Information Policy outlines the minimum security controls that all public and private organisations must meet Rather than prescribing implementation mechanisms, policy requirements should be expressed in terms of obligations, permissions, prohibitions, outcomes, and performance requirements Manage Health Data as an Asset Health data must be managed so that its source and the times and places it is created, changed, updated, accessed, and ultimately disposed of are captured and retained.","Enkola y’amawulire mu ggwanga eraga okufuga okw’obukuumi okutono ennyo ebibiina byonna ebya gavumenti n’eby’obwannannyini bye birina okutuukiriza okusinga okuwandiika enkola z’okussa mu nkola, ebyetaago by’enkola birina okulagibwa mu buvunaanyizibwa, olukusa, ebikugirwa, ebivaamu, n’ebyetaago by’emirimu Okuddukanya data y’ebyobulamu nga data y’ebyobulamu ey’eby’obugagga erina okuddukanyizibwa olwo ensibuko yaayo n’ebiseera n’ebifo ebitondeddwawo, okukyusibwa, okulongoosebwa, okufunibwa, n’okusembayo okusalibwawo ne bikwatibwa era ne bikuumibwa."
"Health data is the foundation of decision-making within healthcare, so it must be carefully managed to ensure that we know where it is, rely upon its accuracy, and obtain it when and where we need it.","Ebikwata ku by’obulamu gwe musingi gw’okusalawo mu by’obulamu, kale kiteekwa okuddukanyizibwa n’obwegendereza okulaba nga tumanyi we kiri, okwesigama ku butuufu bwakwo, n’okukifuna ddi ne wa we twetaaga."
Health data components should always identify the time and place of information creation and change.,Ebitundu bya data y’ebyobulamu bulijjo birina okuzuula ekiseera n’ekifo ky’okutonda amawulire n’enkyukakyuka.
Versioning and metadata are one way of capturing this.,Versioning ne metadata y’emu ku ngeri y’okukwatamu kino.
Services providing sharing or access to information may keep only the most recent or most accurate version but must acknowledge the existence of preceding versions.,Empeereza ezigaba okugabana oba okufuna amawulire ziyinza okukuuma enkyusa yokka oba entuufu yokka naye erina okukkiriza okubeerawo kw’enkyusa ezisoose.
Part of the role of the data steward is to ensure data quality.,Ekitundu ku kifo ky’omuwanika wa data kwe kukakasa omutindo gwa data.
Procedures must be developed and used to prevent and correct errors in Digital Health Steps to ensure the quality of data held by the Digital Health solutions should be implemented.,Enkola zirina okukolebwa n’okukozesebwa okuziyiza n’okutereeza ensobi mu mitendera gy’ebyobulamu egya digito okukakasa omutindo gwa data ogukwatibwa eby’obulamu ebya digito gulina okuteekebwa mu nkola.
This is particularly important for sporadically connected systems and long-running transactions or processes.,Kino kikulu nnyo naddala ku nkola eziyungiddwa ku biseera n’emirimu oba enkola ezimala ebbanga eddene.
"The process for establishing consistency of information should be explicitly defined for service Atomic transaction mechanisms may be used across services, but an alternate mechanism should always be provided to achieve consistency through discrete steps when information crosses organisational boundaries.","Enkola y’okuteekawo obutakyukakyuka bw’amawulire erina okunnyonnyolwa mu bulambulukufu enkola za atomu za atomu eyinza okukozesebwa mu mpeereza zonna, naye enkola endala bulijjo erina okuweebwa okutuuka ku kukwatagana okuyita mu mitendera egy’enjawulo ng’amawulire gasala ensalo z’ekitongole."
Transactional messaging is a valuable and robust mechanism that can support consistency processes but is not generally sufficient; a consistency process definition is still required.,Obubaka obw’okutunda (transactional messaging) nkola ya muwendo era nnywevu esobola okuwagira enkola z’obutakyukakyuka naye okutwalira awamu tezimala; Ennyonyola y’enkola y’obutakyukakyuka ekyalina okwetaagisa.
Users of Digital Health should have access to the necessary shared data required to perform their respective business functions.,Abakozesa ebyobulamu ebya digito balina okufuna amawulire agetaagisa agagabana agetaagisa okukola emirimu gyabwe egya bizinensi.
"In addition, shared data should be centrally controlled and managed.","Okugatta ku ekyo, data ezigabibwa zirina okufugibwa wakati n’okuddukanyizibwa."
"Electronically shared data will increase efficiency as Health organisations can use it, without rekeying, to create new entities.","Data ezigabibwa mu byuma bikalimagezi zijja kwongera ku bulungibwansi ng’ebibiina by’ebyobulamu bisobola okugikozesa, awatali kuddamu kukola, okutondawo ebitongole ebipya."
"Users will rely on official sources of more accurate and timely managed data, thereby improving A common set of standards, policies, and procedures that users should adhere to should be developed to enable data sharing among Health organisations.","Abakozesa bajja kwesigama ku nsonda entongole ez’ebikwata ku bituufu era ebiddukanyizibwa mu budde, bwe batyo balongoose emitendera egy’awamu, enkola, n’enkola abakozesa ze balina okugoberera balina okukolebwa okusobozesa okugabana amawulire wakati w’ebibiina by’ebyobulamu."
"Standard data models, data elements, and other metadata that define the shared environment should be developed and stored in a repository for easy access.","Standard data models, data elements, ne metadata endala ezitegeeza embeera y’okugabana zirina okukolebwa n’okuterekebwa mu tterekero okusobola okufuna amangu."
All users will have to rely on electronic data made available for sharing to execute their respective tasks.,Abakozesa bonna bajja kuba balina okwesigama ku data ey’ebyuma ebiweereddwayo okugabana okutuukiriza emirimu gyabwe.
This will ensure that only the most accurate and timely data is relied upon for Ensure Data Ownership and Responsibility Health organisations must own each data entity held by Digital Health systems.,Kino kijja kukakasa nti data yokka esinga obutuufu era mu budde yeesigamye okukakasa nti data obwannannyini n’obuvunaanyizibwa ebibiina by’ebyobulamu birina okuba ne buli kitongole kya data ekikuumibwa enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito.
Every Health organisation should be responsible for the integrity and security of its data.,Buli kitongole ky’ebyobulamu kirina okuba nga kivunaanyizibwa ku bwesimbu n’obukuumi bwa data yaakyo.
"Therefore, each data entity held by Digital Health Systems must have an owner.","N’olwekyo, buli kitongole kya data ekikuumibwa enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito kirina okuba ne nnannyini kyo."
"Primary Data Source: All health data should have an authoritative, official, primary data source, which should be the location for all create, update and delete actions but this should be in line with data management guidelines of the health sector.","Ensibuko y’ebiwandiiko enkulu: Ebiwandiiko byonna eby’ebyobulamu birina okuba n’ensibuko y’obuyinza ey’obuyinza, entongole, enkulu, nga eno erina okuba ekifo ky’okukola byonna okukola, okulongoosa n’okusazaamu ebikolwa naye kino kirina okuba nga kikwatagana n’enkola y’okuddukanya amawulire mu kitongole ky’ebyobulamu."
The lack of well-defined data ownership may lead to confusion about who can change the data held by the Digital Health systems.,Obutabeera na bwannannyini bwa data obutegeerekese obulungi kiyinza okuviirako okutabulwa ku ani asobola okukyusa data ekuumibwa enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito.
"Otherwise, inconsistent, erroneous, and out-of-date data may result.","Bwe kitaba ekyo, ebikwata ku biwandiiko ebitali bikwatagana, ebikyamu, era ebitali bya mulembe biyinza okuvaamu."
Data integrity is at its highest level when data changes are centrally done.,Obutuukirivu bwa data buli ku mutindo gwayo ogw’oku ntikko nga enkyukakyuka za data zikolebwa wakati.
"Use Common Terminologies and Data Definitions There should be a standard, common and consistent definition of all data held by the Digital Health systems, which should be understandable and available to all users.","Kozesa ebigambo ebitera okubeerawo n’ennyonnyola ya data wabeewo ennyonyola ey’omutindo, eya bulijjo era ekwatagana ku data zonna ezikuumibwa enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito, ezirina okutegeerekeka era nga zibeerawo eri abakozesa bonna."

Security should be designed into the architecture in a scalable and efficient manner.,Obukuumi bulina okukolebwa mu nzimba mu ngeri esobola okulinnyisibwa era ennungi.
The security architecture design should follow a modular design where the overall technology infrastructure is divided into functional layers/modules.,Dizayini y’enzimba y’obukuumi erina okugoberera dizayini ya modulo nga ensengeka ya tekinologiya okutwaliza awamu egabanyizibwamu layers/modules ezikola.

Auditing  Digital Health systems should be audited at least twice a year.,Okubala enkola z’ebyobulamu mu ngeri ya digito kulina okubalirirwa waakiri emirundi ebiri mu mwaka.
"The cycle is enclosed by the architecture catalysts previously introduced so that all activities, deliverables, and guidelines are aligned to the constituents for the EA development to deliver a successful digital transformation initiative.","Enzirukanya eno ewereddwa ensengekera z’okuzimba ezaayingizibwa emabegako olwo emirimu gyonna, ebiweebwayo, n’ebiragiro ne bikwatagana n’abalonzi ku nkulaakulana ya EA okutuusa enteekateeka y’enkyukakyuka ya digito ennungi."
The DHEAF development process is based on the TOGAF Architecture Development Model (ADM) cycle and impersonates the architecture development structure of TOGAF.,Enkola y’okukulaakulanya DHEAF yeesigamiziddwa ku nsengekera ya TOGAF Architecture Development Model (ADM) era yeefuula ensengeka y’okukulaakulanya ebizimbe bya TOGAF.
"The TOGAF ADM is a generic and reliable method for architecture development, designed to deal with most systems and organisational requirements (The Open Group, 2018a).","TOGAF ADM nkola ya generic era eyesigika ey’okukulaakulanya ebizimbe, ekoleddwa okukola ku nkola ezisinga obungi n’ebyetaago by’ekitongole (The Open Group, 2018a)."
"It is, however, important to note that in navigating the architecture process, architects should leverage the reusable assets that are part of this framework.","Naye kikulu okumanya nti mu kutambulira mu nkola y’okuzimba, abakubi b’ebifaananyi balina okukozesa eby’obugagga ebiddamu okukozesebwa ebibeera ekitundu ku nkola eno."
"It is also necessary that the requirements are identified, stored, and input into all activities in the architecture process.","Era kyetaagisa ebyetaago okuzuulibwa, okuterekebwa, n’okuyingiza mu mirimu gyonna mu nkola y’okuzimba."
Health organisations should define all the non-functional requirements of the solution they would like to implement.,Ebibiina by’ebyobulamu birina okunnyonnyola ebyetaago byonna ebitali bikola eby’okugonjoola bye baagala okussa mu nkola.
The architecture team should consider the domain-specific principles that derive the requirements and existing Digital Health Policies and standards when defining requirements.,Ttiimu y’ebizimbe erina okulowooza ku misingi egy’enjawulo egy’ekitundu egifuna ebyetaago n’enkola n’emitendera egy’ebyobulamu ebiriwo mu dijitwali nga bannyonnyola ebyetaago.
"Specifically, it is concerned with determining and establishing the architecture capability needed by a health organisation and defining the principles that will constrain the digital transformation effort.","Okusingira ddala, kikwata ku kusalawo n’okuteekawo obusobozi bw’okuzimba obwetaagisa ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu n’okunnyonnyola emisingi egijja okuziyiza kaweefube w’okukyusa mu nkola ya digito."
The primary goal of this phase is to create a highlevel aspirational vision of the business capabilities targeted by the health organisation.,Ekigendererwa ekikulu eky’omutendera guno kwe kutondawo okwolesebwa okw’okusuubira okw’omutindo ogwa waggulu okw’obusobozi bwa bizinensi obugendereddwamu ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu.
"Therefore, critical activities of this phase should include; identifying key stakeholders and their concerns, evaluating business capabilities, defining the scope of work, and developing an Architecture Vision.","N’olwekyo, emirimu emikulu egy’omutendera guno girina okuzingiramu; Okuzuula abakulu abakwatibwako n’ebibaluma, okwekenneenya obusobozi bwa bizinensi, okunnyonnyola obuwanvu bw’omulimu, n’okukulaakulanya okwolesebwa kw’okuzimba."
"The principal technique applied here is Business Capability Modelling (BCM), used with business process models.","Enkola enkulu ekozesebwa wano ye Business Capability Modeling (BCM), ekozesebwa mu nkola ya bizinensi."
All process models should be associated with enterprise-level information entities to reflect what business objects are accessed or ealized as they are executed.,Enkola zonna ez’enkola zirina okukwatagana n’ebitongole by’amawulire ku mutendera gw’ekitongole okulaga ebintu bya bizinensi bye bituusibwako oba okufuuka ealize nga bwe bikolebwa.
"In this phase, the architects create both the Data and Application Architecture, which they may design either sequentially or concurrently.","Mu mutendera guno, abakubi b’ebifaananyi bakola byombi data n’enzimba y’okukozesa, bye bayinza okukola dizayini oba mu mutendera oba mu kiseera kye kimu."
"Data Architecture Phase is concerned with defining the data considerations that support the Business Architecture, including; data management (i.e., collection, processing, storage, and dissemination), migration, and governance.","Omutendera gw’okuzimba data gukwata ku kunnyonnyola ebikwata ku data ebiwagira enzimba ya bizinensi, omuli; Enzirukanya y’amawulire (i.e., okukung’aanya, okukola, okutereka, n’okubunyisa), okusenguka, n’enfuga."
"As part of the Data Architecture, the architecture team should consider developing the Application/Organisation, Role/Application, Application Interaction, and Application Function matrices.","Ng’ekitundu ky’enzimba ya data, ttiimu y’okuzimba erina okulowooza ku ky’okukola enkola/okutegeka, omulimu/okukozesa, enkolagana y’okukozesa, n’enkola y’emirimu gy’okukozesa."
"Likewise, existing technology components to be supported in the target environment may need to be re-defined to ensure fit-for-purpose and interoperability.","Mu ngeri y’emu, ebitundu bya tekinologiya ebiriwo okuwagirwa mu mbeera y’ekigendererwa biyinza okwetaaga okuddamu okunnyonnyolwa okukakasa nti bikwatagana bulungi n’okukolagana."
The architecture team is encouraged to take advantage of relevant Technology Architecture resources provided by the TOGAF Technical Reference Model (TRM).,Ttiimu y’ebizimbe ekubirizibwa okweyambisa eby’obugagga by’okuzimba tekinologiya ebikwatagana ebiweebwa enkola ya TOGAF Technical Reference Model (TRM).
"As part of this phase, the architecture team should review the target business objectives and capabilities of the health organisation, consolidate the gap analysis results and the interoperability requirements from the Business to Technology Architecture phase, and then organize groups of building blocks to address these capabilities.","Ng’ekitundu ku mutendera guno, ttiimu y’ebizimbe erina okwetegereza ebigendererwa bya bizinensi n’obusobozi bw’ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu ekigendererwa, okunyweza ebivudde mu kwekenneenya ebituli n’ebyetaago by’okukolagana okuva mu mutendera gwa bizinensi okutuuka ku mutendera gw’okuzimba tekinologiya, n’oluvannyuma okutegeka ebibinja by’ebizimbe okusobola okukola ku busobozi buno."
The architecture team should also conduct readiness assessment exercises to evaluate the health organisations ability to absorb change.,Ttiimu y’ebizimbe era erina okukola dduyiro ow’okukebera okwetegeka okwekenneenya obusobozi bw’ebibiina by’ebyobulamu okunyiga enkyukakyuka.
"Finally, centering on the readiness assessment results, the architecture team should develop a series of Transition Architectures (delivery vehicles) to generate a high-level Implementation and Migration plan.","N’ekisembayo, nga kisinziira ku bivudde mu kwekenneenya okwetegeka, ttiimu y’ebizimbe erina okukola omuddirirwa gw’ebizimbe ebikyukakyuka (ebidduka ebituusa) okukola enteekateeka ey’okussa mu nkola n’okusenguka okw’omutindo ogwa waggulu."
"Business value must be associated with the capabilities at this stage, and capability increments should be used to assign the business values.","Omuwendo gwa bizinensi gulina okukwatagana n’obusobozi ku mutendera guno, era eby’ongera ku busobozi birina okukozesebwa okugaba empisa za bizinensi."
"When estimating resource requirements, costs should be divided into capital (to create the capability) and operations and maintenance (to run and sustain the capability).","Nga tubalirira ebyetaago by’ebikozesebwa, ssente zirina okugabanyizibwamu kapito (okutondawo obusobozi) n’okuddukanya n’okulabirira (okudduka n’okuyimirizaawo obusobozi)."
"This should include integrating all project activities, dependencies, and the impact of change into a project Finalising the Architecture Vision and Architecture Definition Documents, in line with the agreed implementation approach.","Kino kisaana okuzingiramu okugatta emirimu gyonna egya pulojekiti, okwesigamizibwa, n’enkosa y’enkyukakyuka mu pulojekiti emalirizza ebiwandiiko by’okwolesebwa kw’ebizimbe n’enzimba y’ebizimbe, nga bikwatagana n’enkola y’okussa mu nkola ekkaanyiziddwaako."
The implementation team should review the migration planning outputs and produce recommendations for deployment.,Ttiimu y’okussa mu nkola erina okwetegereza ebiva mu nteekateeka y’okusenguka n’okufulumya ebiteeso by’okuteekebwa mu nkola.
"It should also identify building blocks for replacement, perform a gap analysis between the DH Architecture and solutions framework and produce a gap analysis report to guide implementation decisions.","Era erina okuzuula ebizimbisibwa okukyusa, okukola okwekenneenya ebituli wakati w’enkola ya DH Architecture and Solutions Framework n’okufulumya lipoota y’okwekenneenya ebituli okulungamya okusalawo kw’okussa mu nkola."
"Additionally, the deployment team should be educated about the overall architecture deliverables and expectations from specific development and implementation projects.","Okugatta ku ekyo, ttiimu y’okuteeka mu nkola erina okusomesebwa ku bituukiddwaako okutwalira awamu eby’okuzimba n’ebisuubirwa okuva mu pulojekiti ez’enjawulo ez’enkulaakulana n’okussa mu nkola."
The goal is to ensure that the architecture achieves its original target business value.,Ekigendererwa kwe kulaba ng’enzimba etuuka ku muwendo gwayo ogwa bizinensi ogwasooka.
"In addition, the architecture team should put in place a change management process for the implemented architecture.","Okugatta ku ekyo, ttiimu y’ebizimbe erina okuteekawo enkola y’okuddukanya enkyukakyuka eri enzimba essiddwa mu nkola."
"The change management process, once established, will help to determine: Circumstances under which the implemented architecture, or parts of it, will be permitted to change and the process by which that will happen; The circumstances under which the architecture development process will be initiated again to develop a new architecture.","Enkola y’okuddukanya enkyukakyuka, bw’emala okuteekebwawo, ejja kuyamba okuzuula: embeera enzimba essiddwa mu nkola, oba ebitundu byayo, ejja kukkirizibwa okukyusa n’enkola eyo ejja kubaawo; Embeera enkola y’okukulaakulanya ebizimbe gye egenda okutandikibwawo nate okukola ekizimbe ekipya."

"The reference model provides a graphical representation to aid the clarification of monitoring and evaluation scopes and identification of expected causal links between inputs and activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts for DH implementations, while the indicator domains and indicators provide a non-exhaustive list of some examples of indicators that can be measured under each stage of the results chain.","Omuze gw’okujuliza guwa ekifaananyi ekiraga okunnyonnyola obuwanvu bw’okulondoola n’okwekenneenya n’okuzuula enkolagana ezisuubirwa eziviirako wakati w’ebiyingizibwa n’emirimu, ebifulumizibwa, ebivaamu n’ebikosa enkola za DH, ate ebitundu ebiraga n’ebiraga biwa olukalala olutali lwa kuggwaamu ebyokulabirako ebimu eby’ebiraga ebiyinza okupimibwa wansi wa buli mutendera gw’olujegere lw’ebivuddemu."
"Stakeholders should agree on the stage of maturity of the DH intervention and determine the appropriate monitoring or evaluation activities to avoid embarking on premature DH results (WHO, 2016).","Abakwatibwako balina okukkaanya ku mutendera gw‟okukula kw‟okuyingira mu nsonga za DH n‟okusalawo emirimu egisaanidde egy‟okulondoola oba okwekenneenya okwewala okutandika ebivudde mu DH nga tebinnaba kutuuka (WHO, 2016)."
"Define stakeholder priorities and their projected impact of the DH intervention and outcomes required to cause the defined impact, and the respective impact and outcome measurable indicators while ensuring that the interests of all identified stakeholders are addressed.","Lambulula ebikulu ebirina okukulembezebwa n‟okukosebwa kwabwe okuteeberezebwa okw‟okuyingira mu nsonga za DH n‟ebivaamu ebyetaagisa okuleeta enkosa etegeezeddwa, n‟ebikosa ebikwatibwako n‟ebivaamu ebipima ate nga okakasa nti ebirungi by‟abakwatibwako bonna abazuuliddwa bikolebwako."
Evaluation of a DH intervention can be limited to its process and early outcomes without the need to evaluate its long-term outcomes and impact if the DH is supporting a health intervention with known efficacy based on prior research.,Okukebera okuyingira mu nsonga za DH kuyinza okukoma ku nkola yaayo n‟ebivaamu nga bukyali awatali kwetaaga kwekenneenya bivaamu byayo eby‟ekiseera ekiwanvu n‟okukosebwa singa DH ewagira okuyingira mu nsonga z‟ebyobulamu n‟obusobozi obumanyiddwa nga bwesigamiziddwa ku kunoonyereza okwasooka.
The outputs should include immediate results of the DH intervention and should also capture usability measures that help quantify how users interact with the DH intervention.,Ebifulumizibwa birina okubeeramu ebiva mu kuyingirira kwa DH mu bwangu era birina n‟okukwata ebipimo by‟okukozesa ebiyamba okugera obungi bw‟engeri abakozesa gye bakolaganamu n‟okuyingira mu nsonga za DH.
Indicators for the availability of resources required to support monitoring and evaluation functions should also be considered while defining indicators for the DH inputs and activities.,Ebiraga nti waliwo eby’obugagga ebyetaagisa okuwagira emirimu gy’okulondoola n’okwekenneenya nabyo birina okulowoozebwako nga bwe bitegeeza ebiraga ebiyingizibwa n’emirimu gya DH.
"It necessitates research and analysis to determine baseline measures for each indicator, while internal analysis and input from the subject-matter experts and other health experts are necessary to determine target measures (WHO & ITU, 2012).","Kyetaagisa okunoonyereza n’okwekenneenya okuzuula ebipimo ebisookerwako ku buli kiraga, ate okwekenneenya okw’omunda n’okuyingiza okuva mu bakugu mu nsonga n’abakugu abalala mu by’obulamu kyetaagisa okuzuula ebipimo ebiruubirirwa (WHO & ITU, 2012)."
"Considering that monitoring and evaluation tasks are conducted at different and various times and by various parties, their governance model must be defined to guide the available functions, roles, responsibilities, and required mechanisms to deliver them.","Okulowooza nti emirimu gy’okulondoola n’okwekenneenya gikolebwa mu biseera eby’enjawulo n’eby’enjawulo era nga gikolebwa enjuyi ez’enjawulo, enkola yaabwe ey’enfuga erina okunnyonnyolwa okulungamya emirimu egiriwo, emirimu, obuvunaanyizibwa, n’enkola ezeetaagisa okuzituusa."

Okusingira ddala, ebitundu bigendereddwamu okukakasa obukuumi bw’amawulire agakwata ku bulamu agakuumibwa enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito nga biwa obuvunaanyizibwa n’okukakasa."
Security Drivers  these are elements (internal and external) that can act as a source of information security for an organisation.,Abavuzi b’ebyokwerinda bino bye bintu (eby’omunda n’eby’ebweru) ebiyinza okukola ng’ensibuko y’obukuumi bw’amawulire eri ekitongole.
DHISA highlights four key security drivers that Health organisations should focus on when identifying security requirements.,DHISA eraga ebivuga bina ebikulu eby’obukuumi ebibiina by’ebyobulamu bye birina okussaako essira nga bizuula ebyetaago by’obukuumi.
Business requirements and opportunities are the key sources of internal security requirements.,Ebyetaago bya bizinensi n’emikisa bye bikulu ebivaamu ebyetaago by’obukuumi obw’omunda.
These have the service-level business requirements that must be met to effectively and efficiently provide services to clients.,Bino birina ebisaanyizo bya bizinensi ku mutendera gw’obuweereza ebirina okutuukirira okusobola okuwa bakasitoma obuweereza obulungi era mu ngeri ennungi.
External security requirements may be derived from threats and the need to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.,Ebyetaago by’ebyokwerinda eby’ebweru biyinza okuva mu kutiisibwatiisibwa n’obwetaavu bw’okugoberera ebisaanyizo eby’amateeka n’eby’okulungamya.
Privacy and confidentiality are key examples of functional requirements driven by legal requirements.,Okwekuuma n’ekyama bye by’okulabirako ebikulu eby’ebyetaago by’emirimu ebivugibwa ebyetaago by’amateeka.
"Security Requirements  these represent an information security functionality that ensures that the security properties of an Information system are being satisfied (Harris & Maymi, 2019).","Ebyetaago by’obukuumi bino bikiikirira enkola y’obukuumi bw’amawulire ekakasa nti eby’obukuumi eby’enkola y’amawulire bimatizibwa (Harris & Maymi, 2019)."
"Security requirements of Digital Health systems should be defined in terms of availability, integrity, and confidentiality.","Ebyetaago by’obukuumi mu nkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito birina okunnyonnyolwa mu ngeri y’okubeerawo, obulungi, n’ekyama."
Monitoring and Evaluation  this is the ongoing assessment of a Health organisation's compliance with DHISA and responding to changes that may impact any aspect of the security governance processes and policy framework.,Okulondoola n’okwekenneenya Kino kwe kwekenneenya okugenda mu maaso okw’ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu okugoberera DHISA n’okuddamu enkyukakyuka eziyinza okukosa ensonga yonna ey’enkola z’enfuga y’ebyokwerinda n’enkola y’enkola.
"Education and awareness  these are programs that create awareness about current information risks and security practices so that DH users are empowered to protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and data.","Okusomesa n’okumanyisa Zino pulogulaamu ezireeta okumanyisa abantu ku bulabe bw’amawulire n’enkola z’obukuumi eziriwo kati olwo abakozesa DH ne baweebwa amaanyi okukuuma ebyama, obwesimbu, oba okubeerawo kw’enkola n’ebikwata ku bantu."
"Security Governance  these are principles, policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures that allow the security goals to be set, expressed, and communicated throughout the different levels of a Health organisation.","Enfuga y’ebyokwerinda Zino ze misingi, enkola, emitendera, ebiragiro, n’enkola ezisobozesa ebiruubirirwa by’ebyokwerinda okuteekebwawo, okulagibwa, n’okutegeezebwa mu mitendera gyonna egy’enjawulo egy’ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu."
"Security Technology  this is a set of conceptual diagrams and blueprints that document what the resulting security system will look like from various perspectives, including; conceptual, logical, and physical architectures.","Tekinologiya w’ebyokwerinda Kino kye kibinja ky’ebifaananyi eby’endowooza n’enteekateeka eziwandiika engeri enkola y’obukuumi evuddemu bw’egenda okufaanana okuva mu ndowooza ez’enjawulo, omuli; Ebizimbe eby’endowooza, ebitegeerekeka, n’eby’omubiri."
Security Operations  these are security considerations for the day-to-day operations of the security services and supporting infrastructure.,Emirimu gy’ebyokwerinda bino bye bitunuulirwa mu by’okwerinda ku mirimu gya buli lunaku egy’obuweereza bw’ebyokwerinda n’ebintu ebiwagira.
"Incident management  the process for responding to security-related events that indicate a violation or imminent threat of a breach of security policy (i.e., the organisation is under attack or has suffered a loss).","Enzirukanya y’ebintu Enkola ey’okuddamu ebibaawo ebikwata ku by’okwerinda ebiraga okumenya oba okutiisatiisa okugenda mu maaso olw’okumenya enkola y’ebyokwerinda (i.e., ekitongole kirumbibwa oba kifiiriddwa)."
Security Governance  establishes a governance model that Health organisations can use to assure that their DH information security strategies are aligned with and support business goals of Mo.,Enfuga y’ebyokwerinda eteekawo enkola y’enfuga ebibiina by’ebyobulamu bye bisobola okukozesa okukakasa nti enkola zaabwe ez’obukuumi bw’amawulire ga DH zikwatagana n’ebigendererwa bya bizinensi ebya MO era ne biwagira.
"H and are consistent with applicable laws and regulations through adherence to policies and internal controls, and provide assignment of responsibility.","h era zikwatagana n’amateeka n’ebiragiro ebikozesebwa nga bayita mu kugoberera enkola n’okufuga okw’omunda, n’okuwa obuvunaanyizibwa."
"Principles  are general rules and guidelines intended to be enduring and seldom amended that inform and support how an organisation sets about fulfilling its mission (Josey et al., 2018).","Emisingi ge mateeka n’ebiragiro eby’awamu ebigendereddwamu okuwangaala era tebitera kulongoosebwamu ebitegeeza n’okuwagira engeri ekibiina gye kiteekawo ku kutuukiriza obutume bwakyo (Josey et al., 2018)."
Digital Health should always be aligned to established governance principles unless a governance body has granted an exception.,Obulamu bwa digito bulijjo bulina okukwatagana n’emisingi gy’enfuga egyateekebwawo okuggyako ng’ekitongole ekifuga kiwadde eky’enjawulo.
"Depending on the Health organisation, governing principles may be established at one or more levels.","Okusinziira ku kitongole ky’ebyobulamu, emisingi gy’okufuga giyinza okuteekebwawo ku mutendera gumu oba okusingawo."
"When adapting security principles to their needs, Health organisations should ensure that they are aligned with the high-level IT principles, which guide the use and deployment of all IT resources and assets across the enterprise.","Nga bakyusa emisingi gy’obukuumi okusinziira ku byetaago byabwe, ebibiina by’ebyobulamu birina okulaba nga bikwatagana n’emisingi gya IT egy’omutindo ogwa waggulu, egilungamya enkozesa n’okuteeka mu nkola eby’obugagga byonna ebya IT n’eby’obugagga mu kitongole kyonna."
The DHEAF provides a list of security principles that Health organisations can adopt for their environments.,DHEAF egaba olukalala lw’emisingi gy’ebyokwerinda ebibiina by’ebyobulamu bye bisobola okwettanira ku mbeera zaabwe.
"Policies  are governance tools used to enforce an organisations guiding principles (Harris & Maymi, 2019).","Enkola bye bikozesebwa mu kufuga ebikozesebwa okukakasiza ddala ebibiina ebilungamya emisingi (Harris & Maymi, 2019)."
"They define the authorizations and a program of actions adopted by an organisation to govern the use of technology in specific areas of management control and are established and maintained through standards, guidelines, and procedures in accordance with related legal and business principles.","Zitegeeza olukusa n’enteekateeka y’ebikolwa ebikoleddwa ekitongole okufuga enkozesa ya tekinologiya mu bitundu ebitongole eby’okufuga enzirukanya era biteekebwawo era ne bikuumibwa okuyita mu mutindo, ebiragiro, n’emitendera okusinziira ku misingi egy’amateeka ne bizinensi egyekuusa ku nsonga eno."
Health organisations should define a set of policies for information security and have them approved by their respective management.,Ebibiina by’ebyobulamu birina okunnyonnyola enkola y’obukuumi bw’amawulire era biyisibwe abaddukanya emirimu gyabwe.
"The information security policies should contain statements concerning definition of information security, objectives and principles to guide all activities relating to information security; assignment of general and specific responsibilities for information security management to defined roles and, processes for handling deviations and exceptions.","Enkola z’obukuumi bw’amawulire zirina okubaamu ebigambo ebikwata ku kunnyonnyola obukuumi bw’amawulire, ebigendererwa n’emisingi okulungamya emirimu gyonna egyekuusa ku bukuumi bw’amawulire; Okugaba obuvunaanyizibwa obw’awamu n’obw’enjawulo eri enzirukanya y’obukuumi bw’amawulire ku mirimu egy’enjawulo era, enkola z’okukwata okukyama n’okujjako."
"Additionally, security policies should be reviewed at planned intervals or if significant changes occur to ensure their continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness.","Okugatta ku ekyo, enkola z’ebyokwerinda zirina okwekenneenyezebwa mu biseera ebitegekeddwa oba singa enkyukakyuka ez’amaanyi zibaawo okukakasa nti zigenda mu maaso okusaanira, obulungi n’obulungi bwazo."
"Standards, Procedures and Guidelines  these are mandatory activities, actions, or rules.","Emitendera, enkola n’ebiragiro bino bye bikolwa ebikakatako, ebikolwa, oba amateeka."
"Policies should be implemented through; technical standards (mandatory directives that must be adhered to by all users), guidelines, and procedures (describe how to achieve the standard or guideline), which are distinguished as follows: Enforcement  the process of ensuring compliance with policy.","Enkola zirina okuteekebwa mu nkola nga ziyita mu; Omutindo gw’ebyekikugu (ebiragiro ebikakatako ebirina okugobererwa abakozesa bonna), ebiragiro, n’emitendera (nnyonnyola engeri y’okutuuka ku mutindo oba ebiragiro), ebyawulwamu bwe biti: Okussa mu nkola enkola y’okulaba ng’enkola egoberera."
"For all Health Organisations, enforcement of information security should be accomplished through a combination of technical controls, process and procedure controls, and management controls.","Ku bibiina byonna eby’ebyobulamu, okussa mu nkola obukuumi bw’amawulire kulina okutuukirira nga tuyita mu kugatta okufuga okw’ekikugu, okufuga enkola n’enkola, n’okufuga enzirukanya."
Controls should be built into the implementation of technical standards and procedures.,Ebifuga birina okuzimbibwa mu kuteeka mu nkola emitendera n’emitendera egy’ekikugu.
Management controls should provide for discretionary invocation of enforcement processes (such as disciplinary actions) as a result of security events or incidents.,Enfuga y’abaddukanya emirimu erina okuteekawo okusaba mu ngeri ey’okwesalirawo enkola (nga ebikolwa eby’okukangavvula) nga kiva ku bintu eby’okwerinda oba ebibaddewo.
"Audit  an Information security audit is an organized, quantifiable technical assessment of how the organisations security policy is employed .","Okubalwa Okubalwa kw’obukuumi bw’amawulire kwe kwekenneenya okw’ekikugu okutegekeddwa, okusobola okupimibwa ku ngeri enkola y’obukuumi bw’ebibiina gy’ekozesebwamu ."
Health organisations are encouraged to establish their own security audit frameworks and have them formally approved by relevant authorities.,Ebibiina by’ebyobulamu bikubirizibwa okuteekawo enkola zaabwe ez’okubala ebitabo by’ebyokwerinda era ne bikkirizibwa mu butongole ab’obuyinza.
The model is described at four levels of abstraction; a.,Omuze guno gunnyonnyolwa ku mitendera ena egy’okuggya (abstraction); omu.
Conceptual Architecture  is a generic technical framework for policy-based security services.,Conceptual Architecture ye nkola ey’ekikugu ey’enjawulo ku mpeereza z’ebyokwerinda ezesigamiziddwa ku nkola.
"The conceptual architecture should clearly state the overlap between policy management and runtime security services management splitting it into identity management, access management, and configuration management services, which represent three roles of the tactical security.","Enzimba y’endowooza erina okulaga bulungi okukwatagana wakati w’okuddukanya enkola n’okuddukanya empeereza y’obukuumi mu kiseera ky’okudduka nga tukigabanya mu nzirukanya y’endagamuntu, okuddukanya okuyingira, n’okuddukanya enzirukanya y’okusengeka, ebikiikirira emirimu esatu egy’obukuumi obw’obukodyo."
Access management services  responsible for assigning and maintaining resource access privileges across the electronic computing environment and for terminating those privileges when they are no longer required.,Empeereza z’okuddukanya okuyingira ezivunaanyizibwa ku kugaba n’okukuuma enkizo z’okufuna eby’obugagga mu mbeera ya kompyuta ey’ebyuma bikalimagezi n’okukomya enkizo ezo nga tezikyali zeetaagibwa.
"Access management services may encompass a variety of components such as access policy definition, account creation, and access control list (ACL) Configuration management services  responsible for consistently setting and maintaining the security configuration across the electronic computing environment.","Empeereza z’okuddukanya okuyingira ziyinza okuzingiramu ebitundu eby’enjawulo nga Okunnyonnyola enkola y’okuyingira, okukola akawunti, n’olukalala lw’okufuga okuyingira (ACL) Enzirukanya y’okusengeka obuvunaanyizibwa okuteekawo obutakyukakyuka n’okukuuma ensengeka y’obukuumi mu mbeera ya kompyuta ey’ebyuma."
Configuration management is where the e. Health security technology extends to include distributed components for all security services.,Enzirukanya y’okusengeka (configuration management) ye e. Tekinologiya w’obukuumi bw’ebyobulamu agenda okuyingizaamu ebitundu ebigabanyizibwa ku mpeereza zonna ez’obukuumi.
"Configuration of the various security services should include; boarder protection, threat detection, content control, auditing, cryptography, and even configuration management itself.","Okusengeka empeereza ez’enjawulo ez’obukuumi kulina okubeeramu; boarder protection, okuzuula ebitiisa, okufuga ebirimu, okubala ebitabo, cryptography, n’okutuuka ku nzirukanya y’okusengeka kwennyini."
User administration may be delegated to an administrator at the affiliate enterprise site.,Enzirukanya y'abakozesa eyinza okuweebwa omuddukanya ku mukutu gwa Affiliate Enterprise.
"Identity registration and vetting functions  provide the means for establishing digital identities for persons that might not go through the human resource system, such as contractors or consultants.","Emirimu gy’okuwandiisa n’okukebera endagamuntu giwa enkola y’okuteekawo endagamuntu za digito eri abantu abayinza obutayita mu nkola y’abakozi, gamba nga abakola endagaano oba abawi b’amagezi."
"Additional functions may be included to support special identity attributes, such as security clearances or citizenship, which may be provided by external organisations other than internal human resource system.","Emirimu egy’enjawulo giyinza okuteekebwamu okuwagira ebikwata ku ndagamuntu eby’enjawulo, gamba ng’okukkiriza obukuumi oba obutuuze, ebiyinza okuweebwa ebibiina eby’ebweru ebitali nkola y’abakozi ey’omunda."
"This architecture environment should have multiple documents, including; Software component layering on servers and network topology diagrams, all network addresses of Domain Controllers in an environment, and documentation of the configuration settings for software components.","Embeera eno ey’okuzimba erina okuba n’ebiwandiiko ebingi, omuli; Software component layering ku servers ne network topology diagrams, endagiriro zonna ez’omukutu ez’abafuga domain mu mbeera, n’okuwandiika ensengeka z’okusengeka ebitundu bya pulogulaamu."
"Design and development guidance may range from overall process guidelines to specific guides, templates, and tools.","Obulagirizi bw’okukola dizayini n’okukulaakulanya buyinza okuva ku ndagiriro z’enkola okutwalira awamu okutuuka ku ndagiriro entongole, ebikozesebwa, n’ebikozesebwa."
"These may include design patterns, code samples, reusable libraries, and testing tools.","Bino biyinza okubaamu enkola ya dizayini, sampuli za koodi, ebitabo ebiddamu okukozesebwa, n’ebikozesebwa mu kugezesa."
All of these are aimed at effective utilization of information security architecture and effective integration into the environment.,Bino byonna bigendereddwamu okukozesa obulungi enzimba y’obukuumi bw’amawulire n’okugatta obulungi mu butonde.
This guidance can be applied to,Obulagirizi buno busobola okukozesebwa ku .
Further guidance on how these can be addressed can be found in ISO 27002.,Obulagirizi obulala ku ngeri bino gye biyinza okutunulwamu busobola okusangibwa mu ISO 27002.
Hs DHISAF has a strong dependency on asset management.,HS Dhisaf alina okwesigamizibwa okw’amaanyi ku nzirukanya y’eby’obugagga.
"Common components include a repository of hardware and software assets (including the configuration and usage information), a capability to discover assets as they are added to the network, and reporting capabilities (ISO/IEC, 2018).","Ebitundu ebya bulijjo mulimu etterekero ly’eby’obugagga bya Hardware ne Software (nga mw’otwalidde n’okusengeka n’amawulire agakwata ku nkozesa), obusobozi okuzuula eby’obugagga nga bwe byongerwa ku mutimbagano, n’obusobozi bw’okukola lipoota (ISO/IEC, 2018)."
"This information may be used for activities e.g., contract renewals, software license compliance audits, and cost reduction activities.","Amawulire gano gayinza okukozesebwa ku mirimu e.g., okuzza obuggya endagaano, okubalirira okugoberera layisinsi za pulogulaamu, n’emirimu gy’okukendeeza ku nsaasaanya."
An inventory of these assets should be drawn up and maintained on a regular basis.,Eby’obugagga bino birina okukolebwa era bikuumibwa buli kiseera.
"This is accomplished by planning, coordinating, and implementing the Digital Health systems and best practices required to create and maintain secure access to resources and protect the integrity of the system and device configurations.","Kino kituukirira nga tuteekateeka, okukwasaganya, n’okussa mu nkola enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito n’enkola ennungi ezeetaagisa okukola n’okukuuma okufuna eby’obugagga mu ngeri ey’obukuumi n’okukuuma obulungi bw’ensengeka y’enkola n’ebyuma."

"There are also ongoing campaigns focusing on promoting health-seeking behavior, emphasizing early diagnosis and improving the interaction time between healthcare providers and patients ( patient is an empowered patient, capable of making informed decisions about their care.","Waliwo ne kampeyini ezigenda mu maaso ezissa essira ku kutumbula enneeyisa y‟okunoonya ebyobulamu, okussa essira ku kuzuula amangu n‟okulongoosa obudde bw‟enkolagana wakati w‟abajjanjabi n‟abalwadde ( omulwadde mulwadde alina amaanyi, asobola okusalawo mu ngeri ey‟amagezi ku kulabirira kwabwe."
"Leveraging the Safer Dx framework,2 which underscores the complexity of diagnostic errors, a series of interventions were proposed at the national, health facility, and community levels to address sociotechnical gaps in diagnostic safety.","Okukozesa enkola ya DX ey’obukuumi,2 eraga obuzibu bw’ensobi z’okuzuula obulwadde, enkola eziddiriŋŋana zaateesebwa ku mutendera gw’eggwanga, ebyobulamu, n’abantu b’omukitundu okukola ku bbanga ery’eby’obulamu mu by’okwerinda by’okuzuula obulwadde."
"Diagnostic errors should be seen as opportunities for learning, ultimately leading to enhancements in healthcare quality.","Ensobi mu kuzuula obulwadde zirina okutunuulirwa ng’emikisa gy’okuyiga, okukkakkana nga kivuddeko okulongoosa mu mutindo gw’ebyobulamu."
"For facilities already engaged in reporting adverse events, it is essential to integrate diagnostic error reporting into existing systems to create a holistic approach to patient safety.","Ku bifo ebikola edda mu kuwa lipoota ku bikolwa ebibi, kyetaagisa okugatta ensobi y‟okuzuula obulwadde mu nkola eziriwo okukola enkola ey‟obwegassi ku bukuumi bw‟abalwadde."
Supportive Supervision and Healthcare System Reorientation Enhancing technical supportive supervision specifically targeting diagnostic safety is crucial.,Okulabirira okulabirira n‟enkola y‟ebyobulamu okuddamu okulungamya okutumbula okulabirira okw‟ekikugu okuwagira naddala okutunuulira obukuumi bw‟okuzuula obulwadde kikulu nnyo.
"Health facility managers should focus on internal supportive supervision and optimize care, particularly during nights and weekends when staffing shortages impact quality.",Abaddukanya ebifo by‟ebyobulamu balina okussa essira ku kulabirira okuwagira munda n‟okulongoosa okulabirira naddala mu kiro ne wiikendi ng‟ebbula ly‟abakozi likwata ku mutindo.
"Health systems must adapt to changing demographics, including multimorbidity and emerging diseases,33 while healthcare services and health management information systems (HMIS) should support an aging population.","Enkola z‟ebyobulamu zirina okukwatagana n‟enkyukakyuka mu bungi bw‟abantu, omuli endwadde ezitali zimu n‟endwadde ezigenda zikula,33 ate ebyobulamu n‟enkola z‟amawulire ez‟okuddukanya ebyobulamu (HMI) zirina okuwagira omuwendo gw‟abantu abakaddiye."
"Additionally, targeted interventions are needed to address mens health-seeking behaviors, as many experience delays or inaccuracies in diagnosis.","Okugatta ku ekyo, okuyingira mu nsonga ezigendereddwamu kwetaagibwa okukola ku nneeyisa y‟okunoonya ebyobulamu by‟abasajja, kubanga bangi bafuna okulwawo oba obutali butuufu mu kuzuula."
Digitization and EHR Implementation Fast-tracking the institutionalization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) integrated with decision support systems can further improve diagnostic accuracy.,Okussa mu nkola n’okussa mu nkola EHR Okulondoola amangu ebiwandiiko by’ebyobulamu eby’amasannyalaze (EHRs) ebigattibwa wamu n’enkola eziwagira okusalawo bisobola okwongera okulongoosa obutuufu bw’okuzuula obulwadde.
Evidence from developed nations shows that EHRs have significantly reduced diagnostic errors.,Obujulizi okuva mu mawanga agaakulaakulana bulaga nti EHRs zikendeezezza nnyo ku nsobi z’okuzuula obulwadde.
"Additionally, enhancing utilization of technology, such as precision medicine and artificial intelligence (AI), can alleviate healthcare workers burdens and enhance care, particularly in rural areas with limited resources.","Okugatta ku ekyo, okutumbula okukozesa tekinologiya, gamba nga precision medicine ne artificial intelligence (AI) kisobola okukendeeza ku buzito bw’abakozi b’ebyobulamu n’okutumbula obujjanjabi naddala mu byalo ebirina eby’obugagga ebitono."
There has been increasing concern regarding unethical practices by some private intentionally misdiagnose or recommend unnecessary investigations for profit.,Wabaddewo okweraliikirira okweyongera ku bikwata ku nkola ezitali za mpisa okukolebwa abamu ku bakulu mu bugenderevu okuzuula obubi oba okuteesa ku kunoonyereza okuteetaagisa okusobola okufuna amagoba.
"Continuous Education and Team Communication Mandatory continuous professional development and medical education programs are essential for healthcare profes sionals, especially in emergency and outpatient implementing diagnostic protocols will further enhance accuracy.",Okusomesa okutambula obutasalako n’empuliziganya ya ttiimu ekiragiro eky’okukulaakulanya eby’ekikugu okutambula obutasalako n’enteekateeka z’okusomesa eby’obusawo byetaagisa nnyo mu nsonga z’ebyobulamu naddala mu nkola ez’amangu n’ezitali balwadde okussa mu nkola enkola y’okukebera obulwadde kijja kwongera okutumbula obutuufu.
"Cultivating a patient safety culture that prioritizes diagnostic accuracy, supported by tools like autopsies and as learning opportunities helps improve patient care and reduce future errors.","Okulima obuwangwa bw‟obukuumi bw‟omulwadde obukulembeza obutuufu bw‟okuzuula obulwadde, nga buwagirwa ebikozesebwa nga okwekebejja omulambo n‟emikisa gy‟okuyiga kiyamba okulongoosa obujjanjabi bw‟omulwadde n‟okukendeeza ku nsobi mu biseera eby‟omu maaso."
Teamwork and Communication Enhancement Maximizing teamwork and communication among healthcare teams is key to improving diagnostic outcomes.,Okukolagana mu ttiimu n‟okutumbula empuliziganya Okusinga okukolagana mu ttiimu n‟empuliziganya wakati wa ttiimu z‟ebyobulamu kikulu nnyo mu kulongoosa ebiva mu kuzuula obulwadde.
"Online peer-to-peer consultations provide real-time second opinions, enhancing diagnostic safety and fostering trust.","Okwebuuza ku bantu ku yintaneeti kuwa endowooza ez’okubiri mu kiseera ekituufu, okutumbula obukuumi bw’okuzuula obulwadde n’okukuza obwesige."
"Future research should prioritize quantitative error tracking systems, expanded private sector inclusion, longitudinal studies, and pilot testing of proposed interventions like AI decision-support tools to strengthen evidence and validate findings in comparable LMIC settings, ultimately advancing diagnostic safety improvements.","Okunoonyereza mu biseera eby’omu maaso kulina okukulembeza enkola z’okulondoola ensobi ez’omuwendo, okugaziya okuyingiza ab’obwannannyini, okunoonyereza okumala ebbanga, n’okugezesa okugezesa ebiteeso ebiyingira mu nsonga nga AI okusalawo-okuwagira ebikozesebwa okunyweza obujulizi n’okukakasa ebizuuliddwa mu mbeera za LMIC ezigeraageranyizibwa, okukkakkana nga tufunye okulongoosa mu kulongoosa obukuumi bw’okukebera."
"The lessons from WPSD 2024 are clear: accurate diagnosis is both a moral imperative and achievable target, one that demands commitment, innovation, and collective action.","Eby’okuyiga okuva mu WPSD 2024 byeyoleka bulungi: Okuzuula okutuufu kigendererwa kya mpisa era ekisobola okutuukirira, ekisaba okwewaayo, okuyiiya, n’okukola okw’omuggundu."

"Given that the vaccines were authorized under emergency use listing, the country adverse events of special interest (AESI) and assess potential safety concerns following COVID-19 vaccination.","Okusinziira ku kuba nti eddagala erigemebwa lyakkirizibwa wansi w’olukalala lw’enkozesa y’embeera ez’amangu, eggwanga ebizibu ebivaamu eby’enjawulo (AESI) n’okukebera ebiyinza okweraliikirira obukuumi oluvannyuma lw’okugema COVID-19."
Using qualitative approaches data was collected through desk reviews and key informant interviews at the national level and all eight sentinel sites.,Okukozesa enkola ez’omutindo data yakuŋŋaanyizibwa okuyita mu kwekenneenya emmeeza n’okubuuza ebibuuzo ebikulu ebikwata ku kuwa amawulire ku mutendera gw’eggwanga n’emikutu gyonna omunaana egy’abakuumi.
Systematic vaccine safety surveillance is indispensable in ensuring public trust of the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) and quality of vaccines.,Okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema okutegekeddwa kwetaagisa nnyo mu kulaba ng’enteekateeka y’okugema egaziyiziddwa obwesige mu bantu ku kugema n’omutindo gw’eddagala erigema.
"In addition, acknowledging that routine passive reporting systems might not be sufficient to allow the rapid assessment and appropriate public health response during COVID-19 vaccine introduction; active safety surveillance is recommended, Guillard-Maure Cet al., 2017.","Okugatta ku ekyo, okukkiriza nti enkola za bulijjo ez’okukola lipoota ezitakola ziyinza obutamala kukkiriza kwekenneenya kwa mangu n’okuddamu kw’ebyobulamu by’abantu okutuufu mu kiseera ky’okugema COVID-19; Okulondoola obukuumi mu ngeri ey’amaanyi kirungi, Guillard-Maure Cet al., 2017."
The specific objective of the HBSSS was to assess the risk of pre-defined AESI following vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine by brand.,Ekigendererwa ekigere ekya HBSSS kyali kya kwekenneenya akabi k’okugema AESI eyategekebwa edda oluvannyuma lw’okugema COVID-19 nga bakozesa ekika.

"Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), are pre-defined medically significant events with cause-effect potential with vaccine product(s) warranting ongoing, careful, pro-active post market evaluation that need to be carefully monitored and any potential association to vaccination confirmed by further investigation(Voss et al., 2023).","Ennyonyola y’ebizibu ebiva mu kufaayo okw’enjawulo ebivaamu eby’enjawulo eby’enjawulo (AESI), bye bibaddewo mu by’obujjanjabi ebisookerwako nga bivaamu ebivaamu n’ebivaamu n’ekintu (ebintu) eby’okugema ebikakasa okwekenneenya okugenda mu maaso, okwegendereza, okukola oluvannyuma lw’akatale okwetaaga okulondoolebwa n’obwegendereza n’akakwate konna akayinza okugema akakakasibwa okwongera okunoonyereza(Voss et al., 2023)."
"To monitor and evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in near real-time and maintain public confidence in the vaccination program, a subset of ten AESI drawn from a total of 27AESl was prioritized based on our capacity as a country and resources needs.","Okulondoola n’okwekenneenya obukuumi bw’okugema COVID-19 mu kumpi mu kiseera ekituufu n’okukuuma obwesige bw’abantu mu nteekateeka y’okugema, ekitundu ekitono eky’ebitundu kkumi ebyaggyibwa mu muwendo gwa 27AESL byakulembeddwa okusinziira ku busobozi bwaffe ng’eggwanga n’ebyetaago by’eby’obugagga."
"All patients that presented with the pre-determined AESl were included in the evaluations regardless of vaccination status with a COVID-19 vaccine, so that the unvaccinated, age-matched cohort could provide background frequencies of the specified AESl.","Abalwadde bonna abeeyanjula n’eddagala lya AESL eryalagirwa edda baayingizibwa mu kwekenneenya awatali kufaayo ku mbeera y’okugema n’okugema COVID-19, olwo ekibinja ekitagemesebwa, ekikwatagana n’emyaka ne kisobola okuwa emirundi egy’emabega egya AESL eragiddwa."
"Retrospective surveillance for background frequencies of the AESI (before vaccine roll-out) was conducted for months (specifically April, 2020 to ).","Okulondoola okudda emabega ku mirundi egy’emabega egya AESI (nga tonnaba kugema) kwakolebwa okumala emyezi (okusingira ddala April, 2020 okutuuka )."
The surveillance staff were supported to carry out examination of relevant medical records including DHIS2 for all participating facilities for background and baseline AESI assessment.,Abakozi abalondoola bawagirwa okukola okwekenneenya ebiwandiiko by’obujjanjabi ebikwatagana omuli ne DHIS2 ku bifo byonna ebyetabamu olw’okukeberebwa kwa AESI okw’emabega n’okutandika.
The surveillance team obtained number of pre-specified AESI conditions per health facility were recorded in the AESI Line List.,Ttiimu y’okulondoola yafuna omuwendo gw’embeera za AESI ezaalagirwa nga buli kifo ky’ebyobulamu zawandiikibwa mu lukalala lwa layini ya AESI.
"For facilities with paperbased medical records, designated surveillance staff (e.g., surveillance officers or nurses/ physicians at the participating sites) were trained to abstract AESl through daily review of medical charts (e.g., admission pre-defined AESl.","Ku bifo ebirina ebiwandiiko by’abasawo eby’empapula, abakozi abaalondeddwa okulondoola (e.g., abaserikale abalondoola oba ba nnamusa/ abasawo mu bifo ebyetabamu) baatendekebwa okuggya AESL mu ngeri ey’okuggyamu AESL nga bayita mu kwekenneenya buli lunaku ebipande by’obujjanjabi (e.g., okuyingizibwa mu kuyingizibwa mu ddwaaliro okwategekebwa edda AESL."
"Additionally, medical charts for all patients eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on national recommendation were reviewed by surveillance staff; (children 12-17 years, adults above 18, those with co morbidities regardless of the age).","Okugatta ku ekyo, ebipande by’obujjanjabi eri abalwadde bonna abalina ebisaanyizo okufuna eddagala lya COVID-19 okusinziira ku kuteesa mu ggwanga lyonna byakeberebwa abakozi abalondoola; (Abaana 12-17 emyaka, abantu abakulu abasukka mu 18, abo abalina obulwadde bwa co morbidities awatali kufaayo ku myaka)."

"The desk review showed that the country was unable to capture safety indicators for the year 2020, probably due to none reporting likely to have been contributed by the Covid-19 pandemic and lock down; the following years (2021, 2022 and 2023) show that the country had a vaccine adverse events review committee that was well constituted and operational, and a national system to monitor adverse events following immunization.","Okuddamu okwetegereza ku mmeeza kwalaga nti eggwanga teryasobola kuwamba bipimo bya bukuumi mu mwaka gwa 2020, oboolyawo olw’obutaba na lipoota eyinza okuba nga yaweebwayo COVID-19 ssennyiga omukambwe n’okuggala wansi; Emyaka egyaddirira (2021, 2022 ne 2023) giraga nti eggwanga lyalina akakiiko akakola ku by’okugema akabi akaali kategekeddwa obulungi era nga kakola, n’enkola y’eggwanga okulondoola ebizibu ebiva mu kugema."
"These included the catchment area (in terms of size/volumes of the population served), the existing AEFI surveillance systems at different the selected health facilities were geographically distributed (north, west, east and central as well as urban versus rural) across the country to ensure representation, but also that they had the diagnostic capacity/ infrastructure (staffing and facilities) that can support the conduct of the needed medical investigations.","Mu bino mwalimu ekitundu ekikuŋŋaanyizibwamu amazzi (mu bunene/obunene bw’abantu abaweereddwa), enkola z’okulondoola eza AEFI eziriwo ku bifo eby’enjawulo eby’obulamu ebyalondebwa zaali zigabanyizibwa mu bitundu (North, West, East ne Central awamu n’ebibuga okusinziira ku byalo) okwetoloola eggwanga lyonna okulaba nga zikiikirira okukiikirira, naye era nti zaali zirina obusobozi bw’okuzuula obulwadde/ ebikozesebwa n’ebifo n’ebifo) ebiyinza okuwagira enneeyisa eyeetaagibwa okunoonyereza okwetaagisa."
"We had to pick a facility from the different regions like in West Nile, we had to pick a facility to represent West Nile region, we went to western region and we picked Kabale, we went to the East and we picked Soroti, also from the engagement that we requested to include private facilities that is to say PNFPs like Rubaga and Lacor because initially the protocol was only looking at public facilities [National].","Twalina okulonda ekifo okuva mu bitundu eby’enjawulo nga mu West Nile, twalina okulonda ekifo eky’okukiikirira ekitundu kya West Nile, twagenda mu Western Region ne tulonda Kabale, twagenda mu Buvanjuba ne tulonda Soroti, era okuva mu kwenyigira kwe twasaba okussaamu ebifo eby’obwannannyini kwe kugamba nti PNFPs nga Rubaga ne Lacor kubanga mu kusooka protocol yali yokka etunuulira ebifo eby’olukale [eggwanga]."
"In addition to these factors, informed by the engagement with various stakeholders, a few private facilities were also included in order to ensure the private sector representativeness and perspective.","Ng’oggyeeko ensonga zino, nga zitegeezeddwa mu nkolagana n’abakwatibwako ab’enjawulo, ebifo by’obwannannyini ebitonotono nabyo byassibwamu okusobola okulaba ng’abakiikiridde ab’obwannannyini bakiikiridde n’endowooza."
At least to take in the demographics that are likely to attend private facilities compared to that go to government facilities so that it brings in that number being private facilities [National].,Waakiri okutwala mu bungi bw’abantu abayinza okugenda mu bifo eby’obwannannyini bw’ogeraageranya n’ebyo ebigenda mu bifo bya gavumenti bisobole okuleeta omuwendo ogwo okuba ebifo eby’obwannannyini [eby’eggwanga].
"Training of Sentinel site teams/staff There was training on case definitions, detection and management offered to all those that were selected to be involved in the project.","Okutendekebwa kwa ttiimu/abakozi b’ekifo abakuumi Waaliwo okutendekebwa ku nnyonyola z’emisango, okuzuula n’okuddukanya ebiweebwayo eri abo bonna abaalondebwa okwenyigira mu pulojekiti."
The training was primarily before the start of the project and was supplemented by an on-job training especially for the members that joined the site team later.,Okutendekebwa kuno okusinga kwali nga pulojekiti tennatandika era nga yayongerwako okutendekebwa ku mulimu naddala eri bammemba abeegatta ku ttiimu y’ekifo oluvannyuma.
This training mainly resulted into knowledge acquisition especially on: importance of vaccines and vaccine safety surveillance; elaborated COVID-19 signs and symptoms; case presentation using the Brighton level criterion level of certainty; different adverse events of special interest; follow up of patients with adverse events following vaccination; how the causality assessment is conducted (the whole process).,Okutendekebwa kuno okusinga kwavaamu okufuna okumanya naddala ku: obukulu bw’okugema n’okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema; Elaborated Covid-19 obubonero n’obubonero; ENSONGA EZ’OMUSANGO nga okozesa omutendera gw’omutindo gwa Brighton ogw’obukakafu; Ebizibu eby’enjawulo eby’okufaayo okw’enjawulo; okugoberera abalwadde abalina ebizibu oluvannyuma lw’okugema; Engeri okukebera kw’ensonga (causality assessment) gye kukolebwamu (enkola yonna).
"But when Iwas taken through the training, when these people used to come [name], Iwas so keen with now these people, like whoever would come and complain, who had a complaint related to what is in the project, Iwould go deeper [Nurse].","Naye Iwas bwe yatwalibwa mu kutendekebwa, abantu bano bwe baali bajja [erinnya], iwas so keen with now these people, like oyo yandizze ne yeemulugunya, eyalina okwemulugunya okukwatagana n’ebyo ebiri mu project, Iwould go deeper [Nurse]."
"Reflecting on the training process, participants also reported on what could have been improved saying that it should have been started earlier; should have lasted longer to allow comprehensive understanding; and incorporating in refresher courses to keep them updated would have been helpful in keeping them updated.","Nga bafumiitiriza ku nkola y’okutendekebwa, abeetabye mu kutendekebwa kuno era baawa lipoota ku ekyo ekyandibadde kirongooseddwa nga bagamba nti kyandibadde kitandikibwako emabegako; yandibadde awangaala nnyo okukkiriza okutegeera okujjuvu; Era okuyingiza mu misomo egy’okuzzaamu amaanyi okusobola okuzikuuma nga zitereezeddwa kyandibadde kya mugaso mu kuzikuuma nga zipya."
"To achieve these, other processes such as the site team meetings, medical chart reviews, follow up investigation and medical support for the patient were conducted.","Okutuukiriza bino, enkola endala nga enkiiko za ttiimu z’ekifo, okwekenneenya ebipande by’abasawo, okugoberera okunoonyereza n’okuyamba abasawo eri omulwadde byakolebwa."
"Only the AESI case detection, vaccination status determination, reporting, causality assessments processes This was the first step.","Okuzuula ensonga za AESI zokka, okusalawo embeera y’okugema, okukola lipoota, enkola z’okukebera ensonga eziviirako Kino kye kyali omutendera ogusooka."
Eligible prospective patients were screened for or identified for an AESI condition during triaging when they presented themselves at the interest.,Abalwadde abaali basaanidde okuweebwa ebisaanyizo baakeberebwa oba okuzuulibwa olw’embeera ya AESI mu kiseera ky’okusalasala bwe beeyanjula nga baagala.
"What worked well was starting with taking history, to see whether immunization was involved, followed by confirmation of the vaccination status and other medical investigations for a diagnosis.","Ekyakoze obulungi kwe kutandika n’okutwala ebyafaayo, okulaba oba okugema kwali kuzingirwamu, nga kugobererwa okukakasa embeera y’okugema n’okunoonyereza okulala okw’abasawo okuzuula obulwadde."
Building rapport with the patient was key.,Okuzimba rapport n’omulwadde kyali kisumuluzo.
"Otherwise, not until theyve told you Ive had my immunization that was when Istarted getting this, probably it could be one reason that brought them to them or do the assessment, thats when you are able to get it [Nurse] For the retrospective surveillance, following patients records on the adverse events, patient files would be retrieved, studied and data extracted.","Otherwise, not until theyve told you ive had my immunization that was where Istarted getting this, osanga eyinza okuba ensonga emu eyabaleeta gye bali oba okukola okukebera, thats when you are able to get it [nurse] for the retrospective surveillance, okugoberera abalwadde ebiwandiiko ku bikolwa ebibi, fayiro z’abalwadde zandiddiddwamu, okusomesebwa n’okuggyamu data."
This part of the process was described as difficult due to missing information (as detailed in the challenges section).,Ekitundu kino eky’enkola eno kyayogerwako ng’ekizibu olw’amawulire agabula (nga bwe kirambikiddwa mu kitundu ky’okusoomoozebwa).
Findings indicated that the kind of challenges that were commonly encountered were that most patients did not have their vaccination cards with them when they came to the health facilities and would only always tell/notify with word of mouth which was quite hard to prove.,Ebizuuliddwa byalaga nti ekika ky’okusoomoozebwa okwali kutera okusangibwawo kwe kuba nti abalwadde abasinga obungi tebaalina kaadi zaabwe ez’okugema nga bajja mu bifo eby’obulamu era bulijjo baali bajja kwogera/kutegeeza n’ekigambo ky’akamwa ekyali kizibu ennyo okukakasa.
Contact numbers were also used to follow up patients where this information was not available at the health facilities or national vaccination system.,Ennamba z’okukwatagana nazo zaakozesebwa okugoberera abalwadde amawulire gano we gatasangibwa mu bifo by’ebyobulamu oba enkola y’okugema mu ggwanga.
"Following up patients was described as difficult highlighting scenarios of the teams going to the communities and bouncing back, making it a back and forth sometimes.","Okugoberera abalwadde kyayogerwako ng’ekizibu okulaga embeera za ttiimu ezigenda mu bitundu n’okubuuka okudda emabega, ekigifuula okudda n’okudda oluusi."
"After identifying a possible AESI at the health facility, it was fully documented as much as possible and reported using the provided tools including using ODK for consideration by the causality assessment committee.","Oluvannyuma lw’okuzuula AESI eyinza okubaawo mu kifo ky’ebyobulamu, kyawandiikibwa mu bujjuvu nga bwe kisoboka era ne kiwa lipoota nga bakozesa ebikozesebwa ebiweereddwa omuli okukozesa ODK okutunulwamu akakiiko akakebera ensonga ezivaako obulwadde."
"Causality Assessment process Overall, several process including case detections, case notification/reporting, investigation and analysis, record keeping, feedback were involved in the causality assessment.","Enkola y’okukebera ensonga (causality assessment process) okutwaliza awamu, enkola eziwerako omuli okuzuula emisango, okumanyisa emisango/okuloopa, okunoonyereza n’okwekenneenya, okukuuma ebiwandiiko, okuddamu kwakolebwa mu kwekenneenya ensonga eziviirako."
"At the facility level, the site team assessed the patients biodata including their full details such as their contact/addresses, next of kin contacts, and whether the necessary tests have been/were conducted or requested.","Ku mutendera gw’ekifo, ttiimu y’ekifo yeetegereza abalwadde ebiramu omuli n’ebikwata ku nsonga zaabwe mu bujjuvu nga okukwatagana/endagiriro zaabwe, okuddako ku kin contacts, n’okumanya oba okukebera okwetaagisa kukoleddwa oba kusabiddwa oba okusabibwa."
"In the process, the counseling of the patients in case of fear and anxiety and any other support in treatments may be offered.","Mu nkola eno, okubuulirira kw‟abalwadde singa wabaawo okutya n‟okweraliikirira n‟obuwagizi obulala bwonna mu bujjanjabi kuyinza okuweebwa."
"Key information needed for causality assessment Firstly, one of the key pieces of information in the investigation was the vaccination status that if available made the casualty assessment go smooth.","Amawulire amakulu ageetaagisa mu kwekenneenya ensonga eziviirako okusooka, ekimu ku bitundu ebikulu mu kunoonyereza kwali mbeera y’okugema nti bwe kiba nga waliwo kifuula okwekenneenya okw’abafunye obuvune okutambula obulungi."
It is smooth when all the information required in the file about the client is available.,Kiba kirungi ng’amawulire gonna ageetaagisa mu fayiro ekwata ku kasitoma galiwo.
You need to have the COVID-19 vaccination card.,Olina okuba ne kaadi y’okugema COVID-19.
"Because when you are inputting this information, in ODK, one of the compulsory pieces of information required is the vaccination information [Site leader].","Kubanga bw’oba oyingiza amawulire gano, mu ODK, ekimu ku bitundu by’amawulire ebikakatako ebyetaagisa ge mawulire g’okugema [Site Leader]."
"In addition to the vaccination card, the other information that was needed to make the assessment go smooth was availability of other personal data such as national identification card, address/ contact (phone and village) as well as major medical/laboratory investigations (both the basic and complicated procedure) attached.","Ng’oggyeeko kaadi y’okugema, amawulire amalala agaali geetaagisa okufuula okukebera okugenda obulungi kwali kubeerawo kwa bikwata ku bantu abalala nga kaadi y’eggwanga, endagiriro/ okukwatagana (essimu n’ekyalo) awamu n’okunoonyereza okunene okw’obujjanjabi/okukola laboratory (enkola y’omusingi n’enzibu) egattibwako."
"Absence of such investigations meant that the case could be lost, or review and decisions delayed since some of the investigation maybe done late or never be possible in the instance that the patient died It is smooth when all the investigations required from the client is also done and updated within the file.","Okubulawo okunoonyereza ng’okwo kwali kutegeeza nti omusango guyinza okubula, oba okwekenneenya n’okusalawo okulwawo okuva ebimu ku kunoonyereza bwe biyinza okukolebwa ekikeerezi oba nga tekisoboka mu mbeera nti omulwadde yafa nti kibeera kirungi ng’okunoonyereza kwonna okwetaagisa okuva eri kasitoma kukolebwa nakyo kikolebwa era ne kitereezebwa mu fayiro."
"You discuss and reach somewhere, you find that, there is some information required from the patient especially investigation but is not there, it becomes a challenge, especially when you are updating the Brightons level of certainty...sometimes you may not be able to follow up the client.","Oteesa n’otuuka awalala, okizuula nti, waliwo amawulire agamu agetaagisa okuva mu kunoonyereza naddala naye nga tegaliiwo, kifuuka okusoomoozebwa, naddala ng’otereeza omutindo gwa Brightons ogw’obukakafu...oluusi oyinza obutasobola kugoberera kasitoma."
"You call, the clients phone is off.","Okubira essimu, essimu ya bakasitoma eba evuddeko."
The client is already discharged or has died.,Omukozi wa client yasiibulwa dda oba yafa.
"For assessments, if we dont have full data of the patient, we kind of get stuck.","for assessments, if we dont have full data y'omulwadde, we kind of get stuck."
"If investigations are not fully recorded or not done or no results attached, its quite hard to conclude.","Singa okunoonyereza tekuwandiikibwa mu bujjuvu oba nga tekukolebwa oba nga tekuliimu bivuddemu, its hard to conclude."
"It is easy when you have all the full details of what is needed, the vaccination card is available, the investigation or supportive investigation is done with results attached [ Most often missing data/information: It is important to note that full patient details were often missing making the process a prolonged go back and forth with most of the cases during causality.","It is easy when you have all the full details of what is needed, the vaccination card is available, the investigation or supportive investigation is done with results attached [ Most often missing data/information: It is important to note that full patient details were often missing making the process a prolonged go back and forth with most of the cases during causality."
"It was common, especially in the retrospective process/ surveillance, that most of them were lacking or were conducted, but poorly recorded or not attached to the patients data.","Kyabanga kya bulijjo, naddala mu nkola/ okulondoola okudda emabega, nti abasinga obungi ku bo baali babula oba nga bakolebwa, naye nga bawandiikiddwa bubi oba nga tebakwatagana ku data y’abalwadde."
"They described a scenario where the laboratory results are requested using a different form, conducted in the laboratory where they are reclaimed by a patient, and then re-written in the patient notes which overall, create huge risks for data gaps in the process.","Bannyonnyodde embeera nga ebivudde mu laboratory bisabibwa nga bakozesa engeri ey’enjawulo, ekolebwa mu laboratory mwe ziddizibwa omulwadde, n’oluvannyuma ne ziddamu okuwandiikibwa mu mulwadde which overall, okuleeta obulabe obw’amaanyi eri ebituli mu data mu nkola."
"It was mostly investigations sometimes times they might be done but not attached to the files, so its quite hard to see.","Yali okusinga okunoonyereza oluusi emirundi gye bayinza okukolebwa naye nga tebakwatagana na fayiro, so its quite hard to see."
"A test is done, but the results are not attached, or the major tests not done.","Okugezesebwa kukolebwa, naye ebivuddemu tebikwatiddwa, oba okugezesebwa okunene tekukoleddwa."
"So, if its re-written in the notes and the patient claims the results, its hard [ The other data that was commonly missing was the vaccination cards and patient addresses/location.","Kale, singa kiddamu okuwandiikibwa mu buwandiike era omulwadde n’agamba nti ebivuddemu, ebikaluba [ data endala eyabula ennyo yali kaadi z’okugema n’endagiriro z’omulwadde/ekifo."
"Participants indicated that for most patients, besides their names, age and sex, the address contacts were sometimes wrong information that did not belong to a patient, or not available for instance the phone numbers.","Abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baalaga nti abalwadde abasinga obungi, ng’oggyeeko amannya gaabwe, emyaka n’ekikula ky’omuntu, endagiriro ze bakwatagana nabo oluusi zaali mawulire makyamu agatali ga mulwadde, oba nga tegaliiwo okugeza ennamba z’essimu."
"In some instances, the available contacts were for others close to the patient which was difficult especially when disclosing the information would be harmful to the patient.","Mu mbeera ezimu, abantu abaali bakwatagana baali balala ku lusegere lw’omulwadde ekyali ekizibu naddala ng’okulaga amawulire gandibadde ga bulabe eri omulwadde."
"Factors that were found to be important facilitators for the successful implementation of this surveillance dedicated stakeholders including staff that were motivated, ,  learning sessions through the causality reviews, , coordination and reporting (feedback and coordination meetings).","Ensonga ezaazuulibwa nga abakulu abakwanaganya emirimu gy‟okussa mu nkola obulungi okulondoola kuno abakwatibwako abeewaddeyo omuli n‟abakozi abaali bakubirizibwa, , okuyiga okuyita mu kwekenneenya ensonga, , okukwasaganya n‟okukola lipoota (enkiiko z‟okukwasaganya n‟okukwasaganya)."
Motivated by the need to fill the gap Buy  in was also another facilitator for the project.,Nga kikubirizibwa obwetaavu bw’okujjuza ekituli okugula mu nakyo kyali kiyamba omulala ku pulojekiti.
There were  high expectations from the national (MOH) and health facilities involved about the project impact.,Waaliwo okusuubira okungi okuva mu ggwanga (MOH) n’ebifo by’ebyobulamu ebizingirwamu ku nkola ya pulojekiti.
There was full interest and participation of the health facilities and staff that was engaged in the study which was very key in the implementation of the project.,Waaliwo okufaayo okujjuvu n’okwetaba kw’ebifo by’ebyobulamu n’abakozi ebyali bikola okunoonyereza ekintu ekyali ekikulu ennyo mu kuteeka mu nkola pulojekiti.
"It was reported that the buy-in by stakeholders was because they appreciated it as an area of concern and were therefore driven by the need to contribute to evidence that could fill the gap created by the vaccine misinformation, fear and rumours.","Kyategeezeddwa nti okugula abakwatibwako kwali lwa kuba nti baakisiima ng’ekitundu ekyeraliikiriza era n’olwekyo ne bavugibwa obwetaavu bw’okuyamba ku bujulizi obuyinza okuziba ekituli ekyatondebwawo amawulire amakyaamu ag’okugema, okutya n’ennyondo."
"There was already a need and there was interest about the problem that was being heard in the public, so meaning they were interested in getting to know and see really how they identify these cases which have been talked about by other people, and they are part of the process of reviewing, documenting, confirming and presenting about them, yes those are the key things that worked out during the trainings [National Some of the participants were motivated by their reported great expertise based on their experience from other research engagements, thus become very resourceful to the HBSSS project.","There was already a need and there was interest about the problem that was being heard in the public, so meaning they were interested in getting to know and see really how they identify these cases which have been talked about by other people, and they are part of the process of reviewing, documenting, confirming and presenting about them, yes those are the key things that worked out during the trainings [National Some of the participants were motivated by their reported great expertise based on their experience from other research engagements, thus become very resourceful to the HBSSS pulojekiti."
Funding and Financial motivation The HBSSS project had a specific budget dedicated to its implementation even if the activities were conducted alongside the routine health services.,Ensimbi n’okukubiriza mu by’ensimbi Pulojekiti ya HBSSS yalina embalirira entongole eyawaayo okuteekebwa mu nkola yaayo ne bwe kiba nti emirimu gyakolebwa wamu n’empeereza y’ebyobulamu eya bulijjo.
All participants indicated that financial motivation was very key for the,Bonna abeetabye mu kutendekebwa kuno baalaga nti okukubiriza mu by’ensimbi kyali kisumuluzo nnyo eri
Timely financial motivation for the facilitation towards the site meetings logistics was critical in the success of the project.,Okukubiriza mu budde okw’okukwasaganya enkiiko z’ekifo kino kyali kikulu nnyo mu buwanguzi bwa pulojekiti.
"This motivation of the site teams was associated with their improved attitudes towards conducting project tasks alongside other when you motivate data collectors or the study team participants in real time and routinely and they know the timelines, it makes things very easy.","Kino ekikubiriza ttiimu z’omukutu kyali kikwatagana n’endowooza zaabwe ezirongooseddwa ku kukola emirimu gya pulojekiti ku mabbali g’ebirala ng’okubiriza abakung’aanya amawulire oba abeetabye mu ttiimu y’okunoonyereza mu kiseera ekituufu era nga bulijjo era bamanyi ebiseera, kifuula ebintu okuba ebyangu ennyo."
"And these are some of the things we have done because we have been able to disperse their allowances on time, and moderate support just for their refreshments for their meetings [National level].","Era bino bye bimu ku bintu bye tukoze kubanga tusobodde okusaasaanya ensako yaabwe mu budde, n’okuwagira okw’ekigero olw’ebiwoomerera byabwe olw’enkiiko zaabwe [omutendera gw’eggwanga]."
It was also noted that having an opportunity for the virtual attendance at the review meetings facilitated the members who could not attend physically to make contribution to the review process.,Era kyategeezeddwa nti okufuna omukisa gw’okugenda mu maaso mu nkiiko z’okuddamu okwetegereza (virtual attendance) mu nkiiko z’okuddamu okwetegereza kyakwanguyiza bammemba abatasobola kujja mu mubiri okukola mu nkola y’okuddamu okwetegereza.
"This was noted as critical component since the must attend at the physical attendance at meetings and related travel in the beginnings of the project were constraining some members given that they also needed to attend to other it goes well when you convene the causality [review assessment]to a place of their convenience, and when they are facilitated to be therethese are people with big businesses and activities that they are doing on a day to day to earn, so they must be assured that the facilitation is available for catering for their allowances and their honorarias for the days for the sessions that they are attending [National level].","Kino kyategeezeddwa nga ekitundu ekikulu okuva omusingi gw’okubeerawo mu kubeerawo kw’omubiri mu nkiiko n’entambula ezikwatagana mu ntandikwa ya pulojekiti bwe baali baziyiza bammemba abamu okusinziira ku kuba nti nabo beetaaga okugenda ku balala kutambula bulungi nga otuukiridde ensonga [okuddamu okwekenneenya]okugenda mu kifo ky’okukola, era nga bakwanguyizibwa okunywezebwa abantu babeere nga banyweze olw’okugabula ensako yaabwe n’ebitiibwa byabwe olw’ennaku z’entuula ze bali mu [national level]."
Simplified tools eased the process There was a general perception among the key informants that the case definition and the tools and all the relevant materials that were used at the sites were simplified which made the data collection and reporting process easier since they were new to most of the site teams.,Ebikozesebwa ebyangu byakkakkanya enkola waaliwo endowooza eyawamu mu bantu abakulu abawa amawulire nti ennyonyola y’omusango n’ebikozesebwa n’ebintu byonna ebikwatagana ebyakozesebwa mu bifo byanguyirwa ekyafuula enkola y’okukung’aanya n’okukola lipoota mu ngeri ennyangu okuva bwe kiri nti zaali mpya eri ttiimu z’ebifo ezisinga obungi.
"In particular, the teams noted that the Brightons criteria were not only new and exciting but was also simple to use compared to other they had experienced before.","Okusingira ddala, ttiimu zaategeezezza nti emisingi gya Brightons tegyali mpya era nga gya ssanyu gyokka wabula nga gyangu okukozesa bw’ogeraageranya n’emirala gye baali bafunye emabegako."
"In relation to the tools, participants indicated that although some processes such as data abstraction was","Mu bikwatagana n’ebikozesebwa, abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baalaga nti wadde ng’enkola ezimu nga data abstraction yali ."
Evidence in the national databases Another factor that was reported to have facilitated the process was the availability of databases at the national level (national database for COVID-19 vaccination) which were critical in the confirmation/validation of the individuals vaccination status.,Obujulizi mu bifo ebikuumirwamu amawulire mu ggwanga ensonga endala eyategeezebwa nti yayanguyira enkola eno yali ya kubeerawo kwa bifo ebikuumirwamu amawulire ku mutendera gw’eggwanga (National Database for COVID-19 vaccination) ebyali ebikulu ennyo mu kukakasa/okukakasa embeera y’okugema abantu ssekinnoomu.
These databases especially the EPIVAC system (the national COVID-19 Vaccination portal) were especially useful in situations when the vaccination cards were not available or accessible to confirm the vaccination status.,Ebifo bino naddala enkola ya EPIVAC (omukutu gw’okugema COVID-19 mu ggwanga) byali bya mugaso nnyo mu mbeera nga kaadi z’okugema tezaaliwo oba okutuukirirwa okukakasa embeera y’okugema.
Training of good quality/ well conducted It was reported that the training (of the data collectors or the study team) was of good quality and was well perceived which contributed to positive expectations regarding the project outcome and process.,Okutendekebwa okw’omutindo omulungi/ okukoleddwa obulungi kyategeezebwa nti okutendekebwa (okw’abakung’aanya amawulire oba ttiimu y’okunoonyereza) kwali kwa mutindo mulungi era kwalowoozebwa bulungi ekyayamba ku kusuubira okulungi ku bikwata ku biva mu pulojekiti n’enkola.
"In particular, participants indicated that the training was of high interest to the team, engaging and introduced new aspects such as the Bridgtons criteria of assessing vaccine related adverse events, the reporting of adverse events, comprehensive COVID-19 information, case presentation and follow up among others.","Okusingira ddala, abeetabye mu kutendekebwa baalaga nti okutendekebwa kwali kwa maanyi eri ttiimu, okusikiriza n’okuleeta ensonga empya nga emisingi gya Bridgtons egy’okukebera ebizibu ebikwatagana n’okugema, okuloopa ebizibu ebivaamu, amawulire agajjuvu aga COVID-19, okulaga ensonga n’okugoberera n’ebirala."
"The other component that participants felt made the training of good quality was mode, in particular the face-to-face training.","Ekitundu ekirala abeetabye kye baali bawulira nti okutendekebwa okw‟omutindo omulungi kyali mode, naddala okutendekebwa maaso ku maaso."
"Participants felt that convening the different team in central points including Kampala, Jinja among others for the face-to-face sessions enabled better learning than if the virtual training was used.","Abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baawulira nti okuyita ttiimu ey’enjawulo mu bifo eby’omu makkati omuli Kampala, Jinja n’abalala mu misomo gya maaso ku maaso kyasobozesa okuyiga okulungi okusinga singa okutendekebwa okw’omubiri (virtual training) kwakozesebwa."
A good coordination system was one of factors described as a success of the project.,Enkola ennungi ey’okukwasaganya emirimu yali emu ku nsonga ezoogerwako ng’obuwanguzi bwa pulojekiti.
"And then the very responsible persons in the had the contact persons or leads, and those leads would then become a useful linkage, so that has what worked well, the coordination was very good [National level].","Era awo abantu ab’obuvunaanyizibwa ennyo mu the had the contact persons or leads, era abo abakulembeze olwo bandifuuse enkolagana ey’omugaso, kale ekyo kirina ekyakola obulungi, okukwasaganya kwali kulungi nnyo [national level]."
"Several stakeholders involved in the HBSSS project From the findings, several partners were involved and supported different activities of the project.","Abakwatibwako abawerako abeenyigira mu pulojekiti ya HBSSS okuva mu bizuuliddwa, abakolagana abawerako baali beenyigira mu nsonga eno era ne bawagira emirimu egy’enjawulo egya pulojekiti eno."
"Generally, it was reported that most partners were providing key support in creating an enabling environment for the project to succeed including overall coordination and oversight, legal and pharmacovigilance expertise by the NDA, availing facilitation/allowances for the study teams, as well as support in terms of vehicles and finances for fuel and other logistical support.","Okutwalira awamu, kyategeezeddwa nti abakolagana abasinga obungi baali bawa obuwagizi obukulu mu kutondawo embeera esobozesa pulojekiti okutuuka ku buwanguzi omuli okukwasaganya okutwalira awamu n’okulondoola, eby’amateeka n’eby’eddagala obukugu mu NDA, okukozesa okwanguyiza/okukkiriza ttiimu z’okunoonyereza, wamu n’okuwagira mu nkola y’emmotoka n’ensimbi olw’amafuta n’obuyambi obulala mu nteekateeka."
"We have made presentations and data, evidence-based information to the stakeholders and these stakeholders range from the funders, CDC team, we also have teams from WHO, we have teams from AFENET, then the teams from MOH, UNEPI, then also stakeholders like the AEFI National Causality committee, then WHO provides technical support especially when developing policies; also provide financial support for investigations and also technical expertise with need of any safety follow up of vaccines [National].","Tukoze ennyanjula n’ebikwata ku bantu, amawulire agasinziira ku bujulizi eri abakwatibwako era abakwatibwako bano bava ku bawa ensimbi, ttiimu ya CDC, tulina ne ttiimu okuva mu WHO, tulina ttiimu okuva mu Afenet, olwo ttiimu okuva mu MOH, UNEPI, olwo era abakwatibwako nga AEFI National Causality Committee, olwo ani awa obuyambi obw’ekikugu naddala nga bakola enkola; Era okuwa obuyambi bw’ensimbi mu kunoonyereza era n’obukugu mu by’ekikugu nga weetaaga okugoberera kwonna okw’obukuumi okw’eddagala erigema [eggwanga]."
Stakeholder engagement was good overall The different stakeholder engagement activities which many participants highly appreciated that they were timely intensive and comprehensive included presentations at various stages of the project from initial consultations (starting from inception phase) to updates and feedback sessions to share evidence and progress.,Okukwatagana n‟abakwatibwako kwali kulungi okutwaliza awamu emirimu egy‟enjawulo egy‟okukwatagana n‟abakwatibwako egy‟abantu bangi be baasiima ennyo nti zaali zituuka mu budde era nga zijjuvu zaali zirimu okwanjula ku mitendera egy‟enjawulo egya pulojekiti okuva mu kwebuuza okusooka (okutandika okuva ku mutendera gw‟okutandika) okutuuka ku kulongoosa n‟okuddamu okugabana obujulizi n‟enkulaakulana.
"Importantly, the directors of the different site teams that were trained which was a very strong point not only for the initial processes but also the whole project implementation.","Ekikulu, badayirekita ba ttiimu ez’enjawulo ez’ekifo ezaatendekebwa ekyali ekifo eky’amaanyi ennyo si ku nkola ezisookerwako zokka wabula n’okussa mu nkola pulojekiti yonna."
That gave us a very good leverageto routinely share gaps early enough so that remedial actions are put in place before they escalate to higher level [National level].,Ekyo kyatuwa leverage ennungi ennyoTo bulijjo tugabana ebituli nga bukyali ekimala olwo ebikolwa eby’okutereeza ne biteekebwawo nga tebinnaba kweyongera ku ddaala erya waggulu [eggwanga].
"Yes, the directors of the identification of the teams that were to be trained because they are the ones who identified for us the people we trained [National level].","Yee, badayirekita b’okuzuula ttiimu ezaali zirina okutendekebwa kubanga be batutegeerera abantu be twatendekanga [omutendera gw’eggwanga]."
"Progress meetings and coordination activities (between the causality committee, national level, and the sites) were key in keeping stakeholders abreast with the site-specific progress and needs which deepened their interest and involvement with the project.","Enkiiko z’okukulaakulana n’emirimu gy’okukwasaganya (wakati w’akakiiko k’ensonga, omutendera gw’eggwanga, n’ebifo) byali bikulu mu kukuuma abakwatibwako nga bamanyi enkulaakulana ey’ekifo n’ebyetaago eby’amaanyi ebyayongera okufaayo n’okwenyigira mu pulojekiti."
"We went ahead and made preliminary [conference]presentations to other external stakeholders, so that is equally engaging the stakeholders and keeping them a breast with information about the study [National level].","Twagenda mu maaso ne tukola okusooka [olukuŋŋaana]okusooka eri abakwatibwako abalala ab’ebweru, kale ekyo kikwatagana kyenkanyi abakwatibwako n’okubakuuma ebbeere eririna amawulire agakwata ku kunoonyereza [omutendera gw’eggwanga]."
The key informants also felt that the stakeholder engagement was good since all the concerns that arose and needed responses were considered and addressed in time while keeping all the stakeholders up to date.,Abakulu abawa amawulire era baawulira nti okwenyigira kw‟abakwatibwako kwali kulungi okuva byonna ebibaluma ebyajjawo era ebyetaagisa okuddamu bwe byalowoozebwako era ne bikolebwako mu budde ate nga bakuuma bonna abakwatibwako nga bamanyi.
This was in addition to the monthly and annual progressive reports that were given to certain key stakeholders depending on the type of the information.,Kino kyali kigatta ku lipoota ezigenda mu maaso eza buli mwezi n’omwaka ezaaweebwa abamu ku bakwatibwako abakulu okusinziira ku kika ky’amawulire.
"Stakeholders engagements were conducted at many levels including the regional level, and DHOs, MOH, NDA, AEFI committee, CDC attended.","Enkolagana z’abakwatibwako zaakolebwa ku mitendera mingi omuli n’omutendera gw’ekitundu, ne DHOS, MOH, NDA, AEFI Committee, CDC yeetabye."
Participants empathized that the project should have included and prioritized all of stakeholders according to their roles stating the regulatory component of the vaccine safety surveillance which they felt was somehow limited.,Abeetabye mu kutendekebwa kuno baasaasidde nti pulojekiti eno yandibadde eyingizaamu era n’ekulembeza bonna abakwatibwako okusinziira ku mirimu gyabwe nga balaga ekitundu ekifuga okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema kwe bawulira nti mu ngeri emu oba endala kwali kwa kkomo.
"Then suddenly [a more personal experience], Imean, it is interesting but so, Iwould say , Ithink it could have In addition, community engagement activities were reportedly not conducted well which presented some challenges during the tracking/follow up.","Awo amangu ago [a more personal experience], Imean, it is interesting naye so, iwould say , ithink it could have in addition, community engagement activities tezaakolebwa bulungi ekyaleeta okusoomoozebwa okumu mu kiseera ky’okulondoola/okugoberera."
A mismatch between community and project expectations were reported which participants believed would have been avoided by comprehensive community engagement.,Obutakwatagana wakati w‟abantu b‟omukitundu n‟ebisuubirwa mu pulojekiti byaloopebwa abeetabye mu kugezesebwa kye balowooza nti byandibadde byewalibwa olw‟okukwatagana mu bantu mu ngeri ey‟enjawulo.
"When you go, they expect you to maybe offer them their transport, and yet when you reach there, after finishing engagement, all you to do is appreciate them.","Bw’ogenda, bakusuubira mpozzi okubawa entambula yaabwe, ate nga bw’otuukayo, ng’omaze okwanjula, ky’olina okukola kwe kubasiima."
"So, it was challenging.","Kale, kyali kizibu."
It was challenging [Data manager].,Kyali kizibu [data manager].
"Challenges faced and solutions during the project implementation The key challenges that were faced include: Site team changes and drops There were reports of some team members leaving/dropping off due to delayed financial allowances for the project sites teams, an issue that affected the team composition in some sites.","Okusoomoozebwa okuliwo n’okugonjoola ensonga mu kiseera ky’okussa mu nkola pulojekiti Okusoomoozebwa okukulu okwaliwo mulimu: enkyukakyuka mu ttiimu y’ekifo n’okugwa Waaliwo lipoota z’abamu ku bammemba ba ttiimu okuva/okusuula olw’okulwawo ensimbi z’ensimbi eri ttiimu z’ebifo bya pulojekiti, ensonga eyakosa ensukusa ya ttiimu mu bifo ebimu."
Discrepancies between the perceived or promised versus the actual financial motivation was reported.,Obutakkanya wakati w’ekiruubirirwa ekilowoozebwa oba ekyasuubizibwa okusinziira ku kigendererwa kyennyini eky’ensimbi kyaloopebwa.
"People could not be able to continue, we persisted for 4 months, then people gave up...we went there when we were 13, but time came when we remained only 5 [ others the motivation, the money delayed coming in, those who lost interest.","Abantu tebaasobola kugenda mu maaso, twagumikiriza okumala emyezi 4, olwo abantu ne bavaayo...twagendayo nga tuli 13, naye obudde bwajja nga tusigadde 5 zokka [ abalala ekisikiriza, ssente ezaalwawo okuyingira, abo abaabulwa amagoba."
"So, the attrition rate was high and am saying this from the experience of the support supervision, you go there at regional referrals, trained like 10 people, but you only find 3 of the original people [national].","So, the attrition rate was high and am saying this from the experience of the support supervision, ogendayo ku regional referrals, trained like 10 people, naye osanga 3 zokka ku bantu abaasooka [eggwanga]."
"Besides the financial challenges, there were reports that some health workers dropped off due to failure to balance their regular workload with additional surveillance project activities.","Ng’oggyeeko okusoomoozebwa mu by’ensimbi, waliwo amawulire agaali galaga nti abamu ku bakozi b’ebyobulamu baagwawo olw’okulemererwa okutebenkeza emirimu gyabwe egya bulijjo n’emirimu emirala egy’okulondoola."
"For some health facilities, the team changes were due to changes such as a member leaving we had a high attrition rate whereby participants who were trained fell off during the implementation phase...loss of interest, others being changed within facilities because you know when we were selecting, we wanted those who were representative and others would change, others were claiming the workload was 2.","Ku bifo ebimu eby’ebyobulamu, enkyukakyuka za ttiimu zaali zivudde ku nkyukakyuka nga mmemba okuvaayo twalina omuwendo omunene ogw’okusannyalala nga abeetabye mu kutendekebwa baagwa mu kiseera ky’okussa mu nkola...okufiirwa amagoba, ebirala nga bikyusibwa mu bifo kubanga omanyi ddi lwe twalonda, twagala abo abaali bakiikirira ate abalala ne bakyusa, abalala baali bagamba nti omulimu gwali 2."
Poor data quality and missing information One of the biggest challenges encountered during the study was an issue of poor-quality data systems especially the issue of missing or scanty information which affected the project negatively by delaying the retrospective case tracking and review process.,Omutindo gw’ebikwata ku biwandiiko ebibi n’amawulire agabula ekimu ku bisinga okusoomoozebwa ebyasangibwa mu kunoonyereza kwe kuba ensonga y’enkola z’amawulire ez’omutindo omubi naddala ensonga y’amawulire agabula oba agatali matono agaakosa pulojekiti mu ngeri embi nga galwawo okukola enkola y’okulondoola ensonga n’okuddamu okwetegereza ensonga ezidda emabega.
Some basic demographic information such as sex and contact numbers missing in the patients records were reported.,Ebimu ku bikwata ku bungi bw’abantu nga ekikula ky’omuntu n’ennamba z’okukwatagana ebibula mu biwandiiko by’abalwadde byaloopebwa.
Also missing key information such as the medical/ laboratory investigations and vaccination card (were either lost or poorly recorded or not yet in the national vaccine database) was a key challenge that made it difficult to ascertain whether a patient had received a vaccine or not [cross ref for details in the Causality Assessment process subheading],Era okubula amawulire amakulu nga okunoonyereza kw’abasawo/ laboratory ne kaadi y’okugema (baali babuze oba nga tebawandiikiddwa bubi oba nga tebannaba mu database y’okugema mu ggwanga) kwali kusoomoozebwa kukulu okwakaluubiriza okuzuula oba omulwadde yali afunye eddagala erigema oba nedda [Cross Ref for details in the causality assessment process subheading].
The data capture in the primary data collection tools in our sites is still a very big gap [National level].,Okukwata data mu bikozesebwa ebikulu eby’okukung’aanya amawulire mu mikutu gyaffe kikyali kitundu kinene nnyo [national level].
"So, this was a bit of a challenge.","Kale, kino kyali kizibu katono."
You know most of the cases were retrospective and charts would lack some information...this affected the process of looking at the real cases.,Omanyi emisango egisinga gyali gya kudda mabega era charts zandibulamu amawulire agamu...kino kyakosa enkola y’okutunuulira emisango egy’amazima.
"So, these are some of the challenges that we have encountered in the process Such poor-quality data was linked to many missed opportunities in case detection.","Kale, bino bye bimu ku bisomooza bye tusanze mu nkola data ng’eyo ey’omutindo omubi yakwatagana n’emikisa mingi egyasubwa singa okuzuula."
Below is a long extract that shows a scenario where difficulties in a vaccination status confirmation related to information gaps leaving out a potential case.,Wansi waliwo ekitundu ekiwanvu ekiraga embeera nga obuzibu mu kukakasa embeera y’okugema ebikwatagana n’ebituli by’amawulire ebirekawo ensonga eyinza okubaawo.
"But for the ones where they dont have a card, in the system they are missing, we would now definitely leave them out.","Naye eri abo gyebatalina card, mu system gyebabula, kati ddala twandibalese ebweru."
"Though there is one case, up to today we still feel convinced that actually it would be true that hes eligible and should be in the study, we have tried all meansbecause we feel surely, he might be one of the cases, though it is just the COVID-19 status, which is a block to that.","Wadde nga waliwo ensonga emu, okutuuka leero tukyawulira nga tukakasa nti mu butuufu kyandibadde kituufu nti HES eligible era yandibadde mu kunoonyereza, tugezezzaako byonna ebikozesebwa tuwulira nga ddala, ayinza okuba omu ku misango, wadde nga ye COVID-19 status yokka, nga eno ye block eri ekyo."
"It came in a bit later, but in the initial stages, follow-up was a challenge, the support, it was not forthcoming.","Kyajja nga wayiseewo akaseera katono, naye mu mitendera egyasooka, okugoberera kwali kusoomoozebwa, obuwagizi, tebwali bujja."
"So, we relied basically on what we have.","Kale, twasinziira nnyo ku bye tulina."
"If the patients file is adequate enough, with the information, we go with that.","Singa fayiro y’abalwadde eba emala ekimala, n’amawulire, tugenda n’ekyo."
"Or phone call, that is the most we would go.","Oba essimu, eyo y’esinga twandigenze."
"But later on, the follow-up support came in, there was fuel provided, and some facilitation support started moving to villages and other districts to check these people [data manager].","Naye oluvannyuma, obuyambi obw’okugoberera bwajja, waaliwo amafuta agaaweebwa, era obuyambi obumu obw’okukwasaganya bwatandika okusenguka mu byalo ne disitulikiti endala okukebera abantu bano [data manager]."
"Limited investigation capacity at site In line with poor record keeping system, key medical investigations which would have been useful in review and decision-making processes were largely missing, either because they were not conducted, or they were conducted and not properly recorded.","Obusobozi bw’okunoonyereza okutono mu kifo nga bukwatagana n’enkola embi ey’okukuuma ebiwandiiko, okunoonyereza okukulu okw’obujjanjabi okwandibadde okw’omugaso mu kwekenneenya n’enkola z’okusalawo okusinga kwabula, oba olw’okuba tezaakolebwa, oba zakolebwa era teziwandiikibwa bulungi."
Such limitations in the capacity at investigations to confirm/validate the conditions were noted as one of the key challenges.,Obuzibu obwo mu busobozi mu kunoonyereza okukakasa/okukakasa obukwakkulizo bwalabiddwa ng’ekimu ku bikulu okusoomoozebwa.
Oversight in information gathering was reported even when the study was structured.,Okulondoola mu kukungaanya amawulire kwaloopebwa ne bwe wabaawo okunoonyereza okutegekeddwa.
"Overall, the participants were concerned that the country has a very poor record keeping culture that there was no system to tract the persons health challenges/history before the vaccination versus what happened after vaccination.","Okutwaliza awamu, abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baali beeraliikirivu nti eggwanga lirina ebiwandiiko ebibi ennyo nga bikuuma obuwangwa nti tewali nkola ya kuggya kusoomoozebwa kwa bantu ku bulamu/ebyafaayo nga tebannaba kugema okusinziira ku ebyo ebyaliwo oluvannyuma lw’okugema."
"So, the time when we should have really done the required investigation, they were not done, so you want to do them now.","Kale, ekiseera we twandikoze ddala okunoonyereza okwetaagisa, tebyakolebwa, kale oyagala okubikola kati."
Icall it going backwards and therefore you may not pick the exact parameters that you want.,icall it going backwards and therefore oyinza obutalonda parameters entuufu z'oyagala.
"Imagine somebody was vaccinated 6 months ago presented with a rush a day after the vaccination, then they keep quiet, or it is treated as any other popular rash, but it persists, then we","Teebereza omuntu yagemebwa emyezi 6 egiyise eyanjulwa n’okufubutuka olunaku lumu oluvannyuma lw’okugema, olwo n’asirika, oba kiyisibwa ng’ekizimba ekirala kyonna ekimanyiddwa ennyo, naye kisigala nga kigudde, olwo ne tuba"
"So, the evidence has gaps because the investigation that could have been done were not actually done [Medical Office].","Kale, obujulizi bulina ebituli kubanga okunoonyereza okwandibadde kukolebwa mu butuufu tekwakolebwa [Medical Office]."
"The history still posed a problem, and missing investigations remained an issue that is a very major issue of data in this country, from what Ive experienced, it is really a challenge [National level].","Ebyafaayo byali bikyaleeta ekizibu, era okunoonyereza okubula kwasigala nga ensonga enkulu ennyo ensonga ya data mu ggwanga lino, okuva ku ekyo Ive kye yafuna, ddala kusoomoozebwa [omutendera gw’eggwanga]."
"The reliance on private health facilities was however very inefficient and presented difficult situations in cases where the investigations including C-Tscans, D-dima were too expensive beyond what most patients could afford.","Okwesigamira ku bifo by’obwannannyini eby’obwannannyini kwali tekukola bulungi nnyo era kwaleeta embeera enzibu mu mbeera nga okunoonyereza omuli C-TScans, D-Dima zaali za bbeeyi nnyo okusukka ku ekyo abalwadde abasinga kye basobola okwetuusaako."
"But now challenges come when maybe they cannot afford like a C-Tscan, like D-dima, those ones are expensive, yeah.","Naye kati okusoomoozebwa kujja nga osanga tebasobola kugula nga C-TScan, nga D-Dima, ezo za bbeeyi, yeah."
"So, investigations, finances [ some investigation like d-dimer, that test is not done in the the test, because you tell the patient to go and do the test from outside that it is expensive 50,000ugx and above.","Kale, okunoonyereza, eby’ensimbi [ okunoonyereza okumu nga D-Dimer, nti okugezesebwa tekukolebwa mu kugezesebwa, kubanga ogamba omulwadde okugenda okukola okugezesebwa okuva ebweru nti kya bbeeyi 50,000ugx n’okudda waggulu."
"So, the patient could tell you that Idont have the money, it was a challenge [Laboratory Staff].","Kale, omulwadde yali asobola okukugamba nti Idont alina ssente, kyali kusoomoozebwa [abakozi b’abakozi]."
"The lack of key medical information sometimes resulted into major delays, the missing out (leaving out) some potential cases and or documentation of only personal accounts which were generally biased or confusing.","Obutabeera na mawulire makulu ag’obujjanjabi oluusi kyavaamu okulwawo okunene, okubulwa (okuvaayo) emisango egimu egisobola okubaawo n’oba ebiwandiiko by’ebitabo by’omuntu byokka okutwalira awamu ebyali bisosola oba ebitabudde."
An instance where two care takers of a baby patient gave 2 different accounts of the situation was reported.,Omusango ababiri abalabirira omwana omulwadde mwe baawanga akawunti 2 ez’enjawulo ku mbeera eno.
"Besides, the patient verbal reports, there were challenges of lack of coordination between the patient, the patient and the health workers) in the whole patient follow process.","Ng’oggyeeko ekyo, omulwadde ategeeza mu bigambo, waaliwo okusoomoozebwa kw’obutakwatagana wakati w’omulwadde, omulwadde n’abakozi b’ebyobulamu) mu nkola yonna ey’okugoberera omulwadde."
"One time Iremember [health facility name], but the father was giving different information from the mother, that made our work a little challenging.","Omulundi gumu Iremember [erinnya ly’ekifo ky’obulamu], naye taata yali awa amawulire ag’enjawulo ku maama, ekyo kyafuula omulimu gwaffe okusoomoozebwa okutono."
"Ithink, the doctor who was supposed to sign on the letter was not there - had left it to the interns.","Ithink, omusawo eyali alina okussa omukono ku bbaluwa teyaliiwo - yali agirese eri abatendekebwa."
"So those are some of the challenges, the missing investigations required to ascertain the Brightons level is what is mostly a challenge [Records Assistant].","Kale ebyo bye bimu ku bisomooza, okunoonyereza okubula okwetaagisa okuzuula omutendera gwa Brightons kye kisinga okusoomoozebwa [omuyambi w’ebiwandiiko]."
"Transport facilitation needs/inadequacies It was reported that transport costs were sometimes needed during processes for confirming the vaccination status, or other investigations to confirm a condition.","Ebyetaago by‟okukwasaganya eby‟entambula/obutatuukana kyategeezebwa nti ssente z‟entambula oluusi zaali zeetaagibwa mu biseera by‟emitendera okukakasa embeera y‟okugema, oba okunoonyereza okulala okukakasa embeera."
The transport was especially needed during medical investigations for the patients who were living far/long distances from the site where the capacity of the,Entambula yali yeetaagibwa nnyo mu kiseera ky’okunoonyereza kw’abasawo eri abalwadde abaali babeera ewala/amabanga amawanvu okuva mu kifo awasobola obusobozi bw’
"Such transportation costs in terms of the time, vehicle, and the money for fuel, although they were later in the project provided for, significantly delayed the process of investigations and reviews.","Ensimbi ezo ez’entambula mu biseera, mmotoka, ne ssente z’amafuta, wadde nga oluvannyuma zaali mu pulojekiti eyalagirwa, zaalwawo nnyo enkola y’okunoonyereza n’okuddamu okwetegereza."
"The other one is also its not easy, we had to mobilize the pathologists from Kampala to go and travel everywhere and sometimes it causes delay, so those are the major challenges that were mainly logistical and reporting 5.","Endala nayo ya its not easy, we had to mobilize the pathologists from Kampala to go and travel everywhere ate oluusi kireeta okulwawo, kale ebyo bye bisinga okusoomoozebwa okusinga okubeera eby’enteekateeka n’okuloopa 5."
"Even when the teams kept learning lessons on how to do better their work alongside the HBSSS project activities including changes in the meeting schedules to less frequent compared to when they started, a report of so busy days with extended working into late nights for some of them was reported.","Ne ttiimu bwe yasigala ng’eyiga emisomo ku ngeri y’okukolamu obulungi emirimu gyazo wamu n’emirimu gya pulojekiti ya HBSSS omuli enkyukakyuka mu nteekateeka z’enkiiko okutuuka ku butabeera nnyo bw’ogeraageranya ne ddi lwe baatandika, lipoota y’ennaku ez’amaanyi ennyo ng’okugaziwa okugaziyizibwa okukola ekiro eri abamu ku bo kwaloopebwa."
"For some of them, a focus on their routine work meant it was especially difficult for them to achieve/progress well on the HBSSS project.","Abamu ku bo, okussa essira ku mulimu gwabwe ogwa bulijjo kyategeeza nti kyabakaluubirira naddala okutuuka/okukulaakulana obulungi ku pulojekiti ya HBSSS."
"For example, some members described how they could have missed potential cases if they are in one ward due to being in different ward for a routine task for example.","Okugeza, bammemba abamu baayogera ku ngeri gye bayinza okusubwamu emisango egisobola okubaawo singa baba mu waadi emu olw’okuba mu waadi ey’enjawulo olw’omulimu ogwa bulijjo okugeza."
"This means the other work is pending, because we usually meet, we had scheduled every Thursday.","Kino kitegeeza nti omulimu omulala gulindiridde, kubanga tutera okusisinkana, twali tutegese buli Lwakuna."
"We first meet, before we can go to our units respective [Team Leader].","Tusooka kusisinkana, nga tetunnagenda mu units zaffe respective [team leader]."
"It was okay the only challenge could have been the fact that sometimes you are in a different ward, you cant be everywhere all the time.","It was okay okusoomoozebwa kwokka kwandibadde nti oluusi oli mu ward eyawukana, you cant be everywhere all the time."
"So, if someone not trained or oriented to it receives that case in your absence, they may treat it as any other case and let it go.","Kale, omuntu atatendekeddwa oba atunudde mu kyo afuna omusango ogwo nga tolina, ayinza okugutwala ng’omusango omulala gwonna n’aguleka."
"In relation to workload challenges, there were reported delays in reporting and causality review processes/ meetings.","Mu bikwatagana n‟okusoomoozebwa kw‟omugugu gw‟emirimu, waaliwo okulwawo okuloopebwa mu kuwa lipoota n‟enkola z‟okuddamu okwetegereza ensonga z‟ensonga/enkiiko."
There was a feeling of difficulty in convening causality assessment meetings/committee because of the various engagement of the members of the committee members (conflicting time demands/priorities outside the HBSSS project).,Waaliwo okuwulira obuzibu mu kuyita enkiiko/akakiiko k’okukebera ensonga ezivaako olw’okukwatagana okw’enjawulo okwa bammemba b’abakiise b’akakiiko (okukontana kw’obudde okusaba/okukulembeza ebweru wa pulojekiti ya HBSSS).
It was also reported that there was delayed reporting and presentation of cases which affected the surveillance process including investigations.,Era kyategeezeddwa nti waliwo okulwawo okutegeeza n’okwanjulira emisango egyakosa enkola y’okulondoola omuli n’okunoonyereza.
"The reporting comes but it comes late to us and the committee, so by the time you go to investigate or send in investigators, many times, the event has already dissolvedand so you cant make a good objective assessment [National level].","Lipoota ejja naye ejja nga kikeerezi eri ffe n’akakiiko, kale we munaagenda okunoonyereza oba okuweereza bambega, emirundi mingi, omukolo gwasaanuuka dda n’olwekyo you cant make a good objective assessment [national level]."
"Ithink causality assessment goes smoothly when you have all the information, one, when they come early, when the case is presented early enough.","ITHInk causality assessment etambula bulungi nga olina amawulire gonna, agamu, bwe gajja nga bukyali, nga omusango guyanjuddwa nga bukyali."
"I think they were reported late, when they are reported late the events have long gone and the investigators go when the patience has recovered long time ago.","Ndowooza baloopeddwa nga kikeerezi, bwe bategeezebwa nti ebigenda mu maaso biyiseewo dda era bambega bagenda ng’obugumiikiriza buzzeemu okutereera edda."
"So, when they report such cases you cant make sense of it, of what the case was, so that issue of delayed investigations Discrepancies in the protocol were also reported to have been a challenge at some point.","Kale, bwe baloopa emisango ng’egyo gy’otosobola kugikola makulu, ku musango kye gwali, olwo ensonga y’okunoonyereza okulwawo mu nkola y’emirimu nayo yategeezebwa nti yali ya kusoomoozebwa mu kiseera ekimu."
Some people felt that the data collection tool at the facility level was not in harmony with the criteria that the national review committee was using during the review meeting.,Abantu abamu baawulira nti ekintu eky’okukung’aanya amawulire ku mutendera gw’ekifo tekyakwatagana na misingi akakiiko k’eggwanga ke kaali kakozesa mu lukiiko lw’okuddamu okwetegereza.
"They noted that while the Brightons criteria were used at the health facility level, the assessment committees and other partners especially the national drug authority used a different approach/criteria.","Bategeezezza nti wadde emisingi gya Brightons gyakozesebwa ku mutendera gw’ekifo ky’ebyobulamu, obukiiko obukebera n’emikwano emirala naddala ekitongole ky’eddagala mu ggwanga kyakozesa enkola/emisingi egy’enjawulo."
"So, the information used by the project to qualify the events as AESI or AFI was different when we went for causality assessment meetings.","Kale, amawulire agakozesebwa pulojekiti okusobola okutuukiriza ebisaanyizo by’emikolo nga AESI oba AFI gaali ga njawulo bwe twagenda mu nkiiko z’okukebera ensonga eziviirako."
"Thats where Ialways felt that they needed to harmonize the tool, protocol so that when we enter things in, we know that we are at per [Medical Officer].","Thats where Ialways felt nti baali beetaaga okukwataganya ekintu, protocol olwo bwe tuyingira ebintu mu, tumanye nti tuli ku per [Medical Officer]."
"So, their criteria were different, yes.","Kale, emisingi gyabwe gyali gya njawulo, yee."
It created a discrepancy between what we were qualifying here and what they were qualifying the other side.,Kyaleetawo obutakwatagana wakati w’ebyo bye twali tuyitamu wano ne bye baali batuukiriza ebisaanyizo oludda olulala.
"So, there is need to harmonize those two [Medical Officer].","Kale, waliwo obwetaavu okukwataganya abo ababiri [abakola ku by’obujjanjabi]."
"Discrepancies were also indicated in the lack of harmonisation in the reporting system for the adverse events, especially in the early phase of the project, which was reported by some participants.","Enjawukana era zalagibwa mu butakwatagana mu nkola y’okukola lipoota ku bikolwa eby’akabi naddala mu mutendera ogusooka ogwa pulojekiti, ogwaloopebwa abamu ku beetabye mu kulonda."
"Participants described scenarios where some patients may report directly to the health facilities while others may call/report to the regulatory authority (NDA), highlighting the need for mechanisms that ensure that no events go missing or unattended to.","Abeetabye mu kutendekebwa bannyonnyodde embeera abalwadde abamu gye bayinza okutegeeza butereevu ebifo by‟ebyobulamu ate abalala bayinza okuyita/okuloopa eri ekitongole ekifuga (NDA), nga balaga obwetaavu bw‟enkola ezikakasa nti tewali bibaawo bibula oba nga tebirina kulabirirwa."
Misinformation and rumours created community resistance Misinformation was one of the key challenges that were faced during the HBBSS implementation process.,Amawulire amakyaamu n‟olugambo byaleetawo amawulire amakyaamu ag‟okuziyiza abantu b‟omukitundu kye kimu ku bikulu eby‟okusoomoozebwa okwaliwo mu nkola y‟okussa mu nkola HBBSS.
Various rumours were reported including those that spread on social media which created a lot of hesitancy and mistrust from the community towards effective engagement with anything related with COVID-19.,Olugambo olw’enjawulo lwaloopebwa omuli n’ebyo ebibunye ku mikutu gya yintaneeti ekyaleetawo okubuusabuusa kungi n’obuteesigagana okuva mu bantu okutuuka ku kwegatta obulungi n’ekintu kyonna ekikwatagana ne COVID-19.
"Generally, many people had concerns about COVID-19 as a disease as well as the COVID-19 vaccine with some community members believing that every health issues they experienced were linked to the vaccine.","Okutwalira awamu, abantu bangi baalina okweraliikirira ku COVID-19 ng’obulwadde awamu n’okugema COVID-19 n’abamu ku bantu b’omu kitundu nga balowooza nti buli nsonga z’ebyobulamu ze baafuna zaali zikwatagana n’okugema."
Ithink the challenges were that there was a lot of miss information and disinformation.,Ndowooza okusoomoozebwa kwali nti waaliwo amawulire amakyaamu mangi n’okubunyisa amawulire.
Even things which were known as other diseases or infection were being attributed to vaccines.,N’ebintu ebimanyiddwa nga endwadde endala oba yinfekisoni byali biva ku kugema.
"Somebody would get an illness and say because you vaccinated me, that is why Iam feeling this illness they have concern and look out for vaccine safety issues because they live in the community.","Waliwo omuntu yandifunye obulwadde n’agamba nti olw’okuba wangema, y’ensonga lwaki mpulira obulwadde buno balina okweraliikirira n’okutunuulira ensonga z’obukuumi bw’okugema kubanga babeera mu kitundu."
"There is usually some fear about what will the vaccine cause, what will happen or hearing rumour?","Ebiseera ebisinga wabaawo okutya ku ki ku ddagala erigema, kiki ekigenda okubaawo oba okuwulira olugambo?"
It was noted that peoples experiences with several rumours on the vaccine negatively affected how they perceived any investigation (had doubt about many tests) that was being conducted by the health facilities including the HBSSS project.,Kyategeerekese nti abantu abaayitamu n’olugambo oluwerako ku ddagala lino kwakosa bubi engeri gye baalabamu okunoonyereza kwonna (baali babuusabuusa ku kukebera kungi) okwali kukolebwa ebifo by’ebyobulamu omuli ne pulojekiti ya HBSSS.
"For example, key informants described several scenarios of hesitancy to provide individual COVID-19 vaccine related information among the community members including failure to say whether they had been vaccinated or not or disappearing on the day of the appointment for a certain needed investigation follow up.","Okugeza, abakulu abawa amawulire baayogera ku mbeera eziwerako ez’okubuusabuusa okuwa amawulire agakwata ku ddagala lya COVID-19 erikwata ku bantu b’omu kitundu omuli okulemererwa okwogera oba baali bagemeddwa oba nedda oba okubula ku lunaku lw’okulondebwa olw’okunoonyereza okulala okwetaagisa okugoberera."
"You make appointment with a client or the next of kin, the attendants, [but you] will find they have escaped.","Okola appointment ne client oba next of kin, abaweereza, [naye ggwe] ojja kusanga nga batolose."
"Like theres one GBS which Igot on the ward after interacting with them, they say that the card is at home...but when Iinteracted with them afterwards, going [community] the following day, Ifound that they had run away.","Like theres one GBS which igot on the ward oluvanyuma lw'okukolagana nabo, bagamba nti card eri awaka...naye iteracted nabo oluvanyuma, okugenda [community] enkeera, Ifound nti baali badduse."
So those are the scenarios [Records Assistant].,Kale ezo ze scenarios [records assistant].
Delayed surveillance process and reduced risk perception There were concerns that the surveillance activities of the HBSSS project although relevant started later than was necessary.,Okulwawo enkola y‟okulondoola n‟okukendeeza ku ndowooza y‟akabi waaliwo okweraliikirira nti emirimu gy‟okulondoola pulojekiti ya HBSSS wadde nga ebikwatagana byatandika oluvannyuma okusinga bwe kyali kyetaagisa.
"Having started in 2022, compared to when the vaccination started (during 2021, 2020), this surveillance project delay made it difficult to track all the cases, most of which were poorly documented.","Olw’okutandika mu 2022, bw’ogeraageranya n’okugema lwe kwatandika (mu 2021, 2020), okulwawo kwa pulojekiti eno ey’okulondoola kyakaluubiriza okulondoola emisango gyonna, egisinga obungi ku gyo gyawandiikibwa bubi."
"Besides having to track all the cases retrospectively since the vaccination had scaled down, risk perception had reduced and there was already misinformation regarding the vaccines which altogether affected the HBSSS processes including the case tracking.","Ng’oggyeeko okulondoola emisango gyonna mu ngeri ey’okudda emabega okuva okugema bwe kwali kukendedde, endowooza y’akabi yali ekendedde era nga waliwo dda amawulire amakyaamu agakwata ku kugema okwakosa ddala enkola za HBSSS omuli n’okulondoola ensonga."
Key informants felt that the community was not well informed on the need for the surveillance aspect of the COVID-19 vaccine  a vaccine that was administered in the past compared to the HBSSS project.,Abakulu abawa amawulire baawulira nti abantu b’omu kitundu tebaategeezebwa bulungi ku bwetaavu bw’ekitundu eky’okulondoola eky’eddagala lya Covid-19 eddagala eryaweebwa emabega bw’ogeraageranya ne pulojekiti ya HBSSS.
"In addition, there were due to limited finances, some gaps in the dissemination aspect whereby participants felt that the community did not get an opportunity to receive feedback from the decisions on some of the investigated cases.","Okugatta ku ekyo, waaliwo olw’ensimbi entono, ebituli ebimu mu nsonga y’okubunyisa amawulire nga abeetabye mu kugezesebwa bawulira nti ekitundu tebafuna mukisa kufuna biddibwamu okuva mu kusalawo ku bimu ku misango egyanoonyezebwa."
"Ithink the community aspects in terms of advocacy [lacked], Ithink we didnt have strong sufficient advocacy at the community level to make people understand the importance of why we ask them questions for things that happened already and sometimes they dont even report [National level].","Ithink the community aspects mu nsonga z'okubunyisa amawulire [ebula], ithink we didnt have strong sufficient advocacy at the community level okufuula abantu okutegeera obukulu lwaki tubabuuza ebibuuzo ku bintu ebyaliwo edda ate oluusi they dont even report [national level]."
"Then feedback to the community when an investigation happens is also an issue, we never get to hear what happened.","Olwo ebiddibwamu eri abantu nga okunoonyereza kubaddewo nakyo nsonga, tetufuna kuwulira bibaddewo."
"If they report that the child was vaccinated and got a problem and the causality assessment is done, the report is not disseminated back to the community.","Singa baloopa nti omwana yagemebwa n’afuna ekizibu era n’okukebera ensonga ezivaako obulwadde ne kukolebwa, lipoota tesaasaanyizibwa kudda mu kitundu."
"That this is actually what caused the event so, that kind of promotes the hesitancy here and the rumours because they are never verified, or if they are, the information is never given to the community [ Overall, there were reports on challenges related to inadequacies in the finances/funding aspect of the project which of course was a foundation to a significant part of the challenges described in this section.","Nti kino mu butuufu kye kyaleetawo omukolo kale, ekika ekyo kitumbula okubuusabuusa wano n’olugambo kubanga tebikakasibwangako, oba bwe biba, amawulire tegaweebwa bantu b’omukitundu [ okutwaliza awamu, waaliwo lipoota ku kusoomoozebwa okukwatagana n’obutatuukana mu by’ensimbi/ensimbi z’ensimbi mu pulojekiti eyali omusingi gw’ekitundu ekikulu eky’okusoomoozebwa okwogerwako mu kitundu kino."
"Such challenges affected the causality assessment meetings in a way that it was associated with a backlog for the the challenges were quite a numberthe committee at one point had a lot of backlogs for assessing and so on, and [names partner], there was some kind of misalignment between the stakeholders on how to get these people funded and be able to do their work to clear that back log.","Okusoomoozebwa ng’okwo kwakosa enkiiko z’okukebera ensonga eziviirako mu ngeri nti kwali kukwatagana n’okudda emabega olw’okusoomoozebwa kwali kwa muwendo nnyo akakiiko mu kiseera ekimu kaali kalina ebisigaddewo bingi eby’okukebera n’ebirala, era [amannya partner], waaliwo ekika ky’okukwatagana okukyamu wakati w’abakwatibwako ku ngeri y’okufunira abantu bano ensimbi n’okusobola okukola emirimu gyabwe okutereeza ekyo eky’okudda emabega."
"Up to now, Ithink it is still there so thats one of the challenges [Surveillance officer].","N'okutuusa kati, ndowooza nti kikyaliwo so thats one of the challenges [omukungu avunaanyizibwa ku kulondoola]."
"Additionally, sometimes people think they need to be compensated for damages or other related issues, but we dont have the funding to cover that [National].","Okugatta ku ekyo, oluusi abantu balowooza nti beetaaga okuliyirirwa olw’okusasula ebyonooneddwa oba ensonga endala ezikwatagana, naye we dont have the funding to cover that [national]."
Key solutions implemented to address the challenges Flexibility in schedules and meetings Fitting causality assessments reviews within the schedule of the review committee with WHO focal point assistance was one of the solutions to ensure that the committees members attended.,Ebikulu ebigonjoolwa ebiteekebwa mu nkola okukola ku kusoomoozebwa okukyukakyuka mu nteekateeka n’enkiiko ezituukagana n’okukebera ensonga eziviirako okwekenneenya mu nteekateeka y’akakiiko akeekenneenya n’obuyambi bwa WHO Focal Point kye kimu ku bigonjoola okulaba nti bammemba b’obukiiko baaliwo.
The scheduling with which was key in time saving and attendance.,Enteekateeka eyali ekulu mu kutereka obudde n’okujja.
"Our secretariat members are willing to work in both modes, which means we dont always have to be physically present to address issues.","Abawandiisi baffe beetegefu okukola mu ngeri zombi, ekitegeeza nti we dont always have to be physically present okusobola okukola ku nsonga."
That flexibility has been the most important factor for me [National].,Obugonvu obwo bubadde nsonga esinga obukulu gyendi [eggwanga].
Support supervision and coordination process Most participants reported that routine support supervision was enhanced which was key in identifying gaps and addressing them accordingly in process.,Okuwagira okulabirira n‟enkola y‟okukwasaganya abasinga obungi abeetabye mu kutendekebwa kuno baategeeza nti okulabirira okuwagira okwa bulijjo kwayongerwako ekintu ekikulu mu kuzuula ebituli n‟okubikolako okusinziira ku nkola.
"In addition, the national UNEPI vaccine system was leveraged creation of the coordination platform.","Okugatta ku ekyo, enkola y’okugema ekitongole kya National UNEPI yakozesebwa okutondawo omukutu gw’okukwasaganya emirimu."
"After data analysis, we share the feedback instantly on the progress and give information where theres a gap and we can address that [National level].","Oluvannyuma lw’okwekenneenya amawulire, tugabana ebiddibwamu mu bwangu ku nkulaakulana era tuwa amawulire awali ekituli era tusobola okukola ku ddaala eryo [ly’eggwanga]."
Training new team members The challenge of changes in team composition/attrition due to several reasons was solved by training of new health workers to join the team.,Okutendeka bammemba ba ttiimu abapya Okusoomoozebwa kw’enkyukakyuka mu nsengeka ya ttiimu/okugenda mu maaso olw’ensonga eziwerako kwagonjoolwa nga batendeka abakozi b’ebyobulamu abapya okwegatta ku ttiimu.
"It was reported that especially during the causality assessment meetings, site team leads were encouraged to train and fill up the teams.","Kyategeezeddwa nti naddala mu nkiiko z’okukebera ensonga eziviirako, abakulembeze ba ttiimu y’ekifo baakubirizibwa okutendekebwa n’okujjuza ttiimu."
"However, although the training for replacements was on job and hands on, there were reports from some of those that were trained that the training was short leaving them not feeling equipped well enough in time.","Wabula wadde ng’okutendekebwa kw’abadda mu bigere kwali ku mulimu n’emikono, waaliwo amawulire okuva mu bamu ku abo abaali batendekeddwa nti okutendekebwa kwali kumpi nga babaleka nga tebawulira bulungi mu budde."
Facilitating patient follow up Findings indicate that fuel for the information was later provided to the into their communities was noted when most cases that were presented at the review meetings were sometimes disqualified or delayed due to lack of evidence especially the expensive medical investigations.,Okukwasaganya ebizuuliddwa mu kugoberera omulwadde biraga nti amafuta g’amawulire oluvannyuma gaaweebwa abayingira mu bitundu byabwe kyategeerekeka ng’emisango egisinga egyanjulwa mu nkiiko z’okuddamu okwetegereza oluusi gyaggyibwako ebisaanyizo oba okulwawo olw’obutaba na bujulizi naddala okunoonyereza kw’abasawo okw’ebbeeyi.
"In some instances, the medical experts were transported to the communities, and for the patients, the medical investigations were supported.","Mu mbeera ezimu, abakugu mu by’obujjanjabi baatwalibwa mu bitundu, era eri abalwadde, okunoonyereza kw’abasawo kwawagirwa."
"Financing all the necessary investigations where the patient was unable to or cost sharing with the patients where they could afford some part of the cots was reported as one of the key solutions that enabled the project to deal with the missing information/investigations and the related we had to give support, fuel to the sites to do follow up of the cases within their regional coverage, so this one has helped us a lot because the sites could follow up the cases physically, drive there, see the cases, and probably get the information from the cases at their homes [National level].","Financing all the necessary investigations where the patient was unable to or cost sharing with the patients where they could afford some part of the cots was reported as one of the key solutions that enabled the project to deal with the missing information/investigations and the related we had to give support, fuel to the sites to do follow up of the cases within their regional coverage, so this one has helped us a lot because the sites could follow up the cases physically, drive there, see the cases, and probably get the information from the cases at their homes [Eddaala ly’eggwanga]."
"And the other thing was also the support to the cases to do some laboratory and radiological investigations, because when they were making presentations, we identified that cases were being dropped because they lacked evidence of laboratory and radiology resultswe could support the investigation either 100% for those who completely cant afford, or we cost share with the case.","Era ekintu ekirala era kyali kya buwagizi eri emisango okukola okunoonyereza okumu okwa laboratory ne radiological, kubanga bwe baali bakola ennyanjula, twazuula nti emisango gyali gisuulibwa kubanga tegiriimu bujulizi bwa bivudde mu laboratory ne radiology tuyinza okuwagira okunoonyereza oba 100% eri abo abasobola ddala okukola, oba tusaasaanya okugabana n’omusango."
Phone numbers and addresses were used to track patients in their communities to confirm their vaccination status.,Ennamba z’essimu n’endagiriro zaakozesebwa okulondoola abalwadde mu bitundu byabwe okukakasa embeera y’okugema kwabwe.
Impact- benefits of HBSSS project implementation Findings indicate some impact on the health facilities and community as described in the different key benefits the participants felt that can be attributed to the project.,Impact- benefits of HBSSS Project Implementation Findings ziraga ebimu ku bikwata ku bifo by‟ebyobulamu n‟abantu b‟omukitundu nga bwe kinyonyoddwa mu migaso emikulu egy‟enjawulo abeetabye mu kulonda gye baawulira nti giyinza okuteekebwa ku pulojekiti.
"These are related to timely reporting and investigation of suspected AEFI, increase in number of AEFI reports, staff knowledge about vaccine safety surveillance and improved patient care.","Bino byekuusa ku kuwa lipoota mu budde n‟okunoonyereza ku AEFI eteeberezebwa, okweyongera kw‟omuwendo gwa lipoota za AEFI, okumanya kw‟abakozi ku kulondoola obukuumi bw‟okugema n‟okulongoosa okulabirira abalwadde."
A great improvement in the skills/abilities for the presentation of cases to the review committee compared to when they began was reported which was a key indicator for increased technical capacity in surveillance of vaccine safety.,Okulongoosa ennyo mu bukugu/obusobozi bw’okwanjula emisango eri akakiiko akeekenneenya bw’ogeraageranya ne ddi lwe baatandika kyaloopebwa ekintu ekikulu eky’okwongera ku busobozi bw’eby’ekikugu mu kulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema.
"For some of them, it was their first time engaging with the causality committees.","Abamu ku bo, gwe gwali omulundi gwabwe ogusoose okwenyigira mu bukiiko obuleeta endwadde."
"And it was really a challenge at the start, but in the process, the committee did mentorship and built their capacity, and this has improved over time [National level].","Era ddala kyali kusoomoozebwa ku ntandikwa, naye mu nkola, akakiiko kaakola okubuulirira n’okuzimba obusobozi bwabwe, era kino kiteredde okumala ekiseera [omutendera gw’eggwanga]."
"These health workers involved in this activity were believed by participants to be critical in future as trainers of trainees needed for the continuation of the HBSSS, a similar project or a surveillance system.","Abakozi bano ab’ebyobulamu abeenyigira mu mulimu guno baali bakkirizibwa abeetabye mu kugezesebwa okuba abakulu mu biseera eby’omu maaso ng’abatendesi b’abatendekebwa abeetaagisa okugenda mu maaso n’aba HBSSS, pulojekiti efaananako bwetyo oba enkola y’okulondoola."
It is important to note that the project was reportedly an opportunity for the capacity building for not only the and causality review/assessment committees.,Kikulu okumanya nti pulojekiti eno kigambibwa nti yali mukisa gwa kuzimba busobozi bwa bukiiko bwa Review/Assessment obw’okukebera obutali bumativu bwokka.
"It was reported that the HBSSS project experience and lessons added a lot of momentum to other surveillance and causality assessment work, improved information transmission, and enhanced preparation for other pandemics.","Kyategeezeddwa nti obumanyirivu bwa pulojekiti ya HBSSS n’eby’okuyiga byayongera amaanyi mangi ku mirimu emirala egy’okulondoola n’okukebera ensonga, okulongoosa mu kutambuza amawulire, n’okuteekateeka ssennyiga omukambwe omulala."
"The lessons from COVID-19 have been invaluable for strengthening routine immunization, which is the best way to prepare for pandemics.","Eby’okuyiga okuva mu COVID-19 bibadde bya mugaso nnyo mu kunyweza okugema okwa bulijjo, nga eno y’engeri esinga obulungi ey’okwetegekera ssennyiga omukambwe."
Increased awareness and reports on adverse events It was noted that the awareness on adverse events and the need to report them had increased.,Okwongera okumanyisa abantu n‟alipoota ku bikolwa ebibi kyategeezebwa nti okumanyisa abantu ku bikolwa ebibi n‟obwetaavu bw‟okubitegeeza kwali kweyongedde.
"Even though it was with a selected team, there has been collaboration","Newankubadde nga kyali ne ttiimu erongooseddwa, wabaddewo okukolagana ."
Some of the site team members had engaged their community members in informal advice setting encouraging them to report any complaint they thought was related to COVID-19 vaccine.,Abamu ku bammemba ba ttiimu y’omukutu baali bakwataganye n’abantu baabwe mu kuwabula okutali kwa mu butongole nga babakubiriza okuloopa okwemulugunya kwonna kwe balowooza nti kwekuusa ku kugema COVID-19.
"Iwould just advise them whoever would complain, even in my village, Iwould just advise them, you go to the and so you never know, maybe you might be one of them and we can easily cure it [Nurse].","I would just advise themwo ani agenda okwemulugunya, ne mu kyalo kyange, nandibadde mbawabula, you go to the and so you never know, maybe you might be one of them and we can easily cure it [Nurse]."
"So, Ithink that aspect of community sensitization to make sure that in case they realize something maybe happening, they can know where to go and where to report it [Data manager] Some improved patient care was also reported by participants who expected that it would have been greater if the project had started earlier along the initial COVID-19 vaccination activities.","Kale, ithink that aspect of community sensitization okukakasa nti mu mbeera nga bakitegedde nti waliwo ekiyinza okubaawo, basobola okumanya wa we bagenda ne wa we balina okukitegeeza [data manager] some improved patient care was also reploted by participties that it would have been greating singa pulojekiti yali etandika emabegako along the initial COVID-19 vaccination activities."
The reported improvement in the care for patients was partly linked to the need of improved data management and investigations during the review/surveillance process.,Okulongoosa okwaloopebwa mu kulabirira abalwadde kwali kukwatagana ekitundu ku bwetaavu bw’okulongoosa mu kuddukanya amawulire n’okunoonyereza mu nkola y’okuddamu okwetegereza/okulondoola.
"The same diligence was said to be happening in terms of other different patient data, and beyond the site teams that were directly involved this research also improved on the health care delivery.","Obunyiikivu bwe bumu bwali bugambibwa nti bugenda mu maaso mu nsonga z’ebikwata ku balwadde ebirala eby’enjawulo, era okusukka ttiimu z’ekifo ezaali zikwatibwako butereevu okunoonyereza kuno nazo zalongoosa ku kutuusa obujjanjabi."
There are some of the investigations they were sometimes neglecting.,Waliwo ebimu ku binoonyereza bye baali oluusi nga tebalagajjalira.
"So, when a case is found, thorough investigation is done on a patient before the case is part of the study [Records Officer].","Kale, omusango bwe guzuulibwa, okunoonyereza okujjuvu kukolebwa ku mulwadde ng’omusango tegunnabaawo kitundu kya kunoonyereza [Records Officer]."
Ifeel it has greatly impacted the accuracy of the information.,Ifeel Kikosezza nnyo obutuufu bw’amawulire.
The back-and-forth movement in the process makes people realize the importance of certain data that should have been collected.,Ekibiina ky’okudda emabega n’okudda emabega kireetera abantu okutegeera obukulu bw’ebiwandiiko ebimu ebyandibadde bikung’aanyizibwa.
"Its retrospective, kind of like a post-mortem, but if it was prospective, even the patient being monitored would benefit because the necessary data would be collected in real-time.... going forward, Ithink it has truly made an impact, but it would be more effective if it was done deliberately from the start [National level].","Its retrospective, kind of like a post-mortem, naye singa kyali kisuubirwa, n’omulwadde okulondoolebwa yandiganyuddwa kubanga data eyetaagisa yandikuŋŋaanyiziddwa mu kiseera ekituufu.... Okugenda mu maaso, ithink ddala kikoze impact, naye kyandibadde kirungi nnyo singa kikolebwa mu bugenderevu okuva ku ntandikwa [national level]."
"On the other hand, a few participants felt that the observed improvement in data collection and patient care was driven by the need to have data for the causality assessment committee and not an improvement in the actual health care.","Ku luuyi olulala, abatono abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baawulira nti okulongoosa okwalabiddwa mu kukungaanya ebikwata ku bantu n’okulabirira abalwadde kwava ku bwetaavu bw’okuba n’ebikwata ku kakiiko akakebera ensonga ezivaako embeera eno so si kulongoosa mu bujjanjabi obwennyini."
"Similarly, although knowledge was said to have increased to some extent, some gaps were reported sending mixed reactions.","Mu ngeri y’emu, wadde nga kigambibwa nti okumanya kweyongedde okutuuka ku ddaala eritali limu, ebituli ebimu byaloopebwa nga bisindika ebikolwa ebitabule."
"So, Ido not think it has made a very, very big difference [National].","Kale, ido si kulowooza nti kikoze enjawulo nnene nnyo nnyo [national]."
"There have been gains, but the challenge remains in utilizing the data effectively.","Wabaddewo amagoba, naye okusoomoozebwa kukyali mu kukozesa data mu ngeri ennungi."
"Were generating a lot of data, but the capacity to use it is still lacking.","baali bakola data nnyingi, naye obusobozi okugikozesa bukyabula."
"Thats why Imentioned the importance of training health workers on how to better use the data [ Ithink the training has helped, the knowledge they have gained is supposed to be there, because Iknow logistics have now gone down but the knowledge at least and the awareness of the health workers has improved so we are now trying to put in place our own systems to keep the process on going [Director].","Thats why mentioned the importance of training health workers on how to betly use the data [ ithink the training has helped, okumanya kwe bafunye kuteekeddwa okubaawo, kubanga iKnow logistics kati zigenze wansi naye okumanya waakiri n’okumanyisa abakozi b’ebyobulamu kulongooseddwa kale kati tugezaako okuteekawo enkola zaffe okukuuma enkola ku kugenda [director]."
Proof of vaccine safety surveillance feasibility One of the successes that participants felt was key was that the protocol was fully implemented well in reference to time and deliverables and emphasized that what remained was the need to go beyond the project phase.,Obukakafu bw’okulondoola obukuumi bw’eddagala ly’okugema Ekimu ku bituukiddwaako abeetabye mu kugezesebwa kye baali bawulira nti kyali kikulu kwe kuba nti enkola eno yateekebwa mu nkola mu bujjuvu mu kujuliza ebiseera n’ebigenda okukolebwa era n’eggumiza nti ekyasigalawo kyali kyetaagisa okusukka omutendera gwa pulojekiti.
"The lessons from the implementation itself offered an opportunity to understand the information that can inform not only continuity, but also scale up of the HBSSS or a similar project to other health facilities (details are described in the section on Feasibility And Sustainability Of Using HBSSS below.","Eby’okuyiga okuva mu nkola yennyini byawa omukisa okutegeera amawulire agasobola okutegeeza si kugenda mu maaso kwokka, wabula n’okulinnyisa HBSSS oba pulojekiti efaananako n’ey’ebyobulamu ebirala (ebisingawo byogerwako mu kitundu ekikwata ku busobozi n’okuyimirizaawo okukozesa HBSSS wansi."
"Idont think there is anything left [undone], we have thoroughly tried to exhaust it in line with our protocol, and in line with our protocol, we have exhausted what we were supposed to do [National level].","Idont think waliwo ekintu kyonna ekisigadde [underone], tugezezzaako ddala okukikooya mu kukwatagana ne protocol yaffe, era nga kikwatagana ne protocol yaffe, tukooye kye twali tulina okukola [national level]."
"What remains now is to see how we can scale up, because for me, its like a proof of concept  we have shown that it is possible.","Ekisigaddewo kati kwe kulaba engeri gye tuyinza okulinnyisa, kubanga ku lwange, its like a proof of concept tulaze nti kisoboka."
The next step is figuring out how to expand this to other mindset change in other people [National level].,Ekiddako kwe kuzuula engeri y’okugaziya kino ku nkyukakyuka endala ez’endowooza mu bantu abalala [omutendera gw’eggwanga].
"Many participants recommended that the active surveillance for vaccine safety should be routinely done at on adverse events of special interest, but also track patients complaints and forward them to the concerned persons/offices to proactively address them.","Bangi ku beetabye mu kugezesebwa kuno baawa amagezi nti okulondoola ennyo obukuumi bw‟okugema kulina okukolebwa bulijjo ku bikolwa ebibi eby‟enjawulo, naye n‟okulondoola okwemulugunya kw‟abalwadde n‟okubaweereza eri abantu/abiri abakwatibwako okusobola okubikolako mu ngeri ey‟obwegendereza."
"Scale up the active vaccine safety surveillance justified As earlier noted, findings indicate that participants strongly felt that active vaccine safety surveillance should not only be continued beyond this project into a routine health service, but also scaled up to other","Scale up the active vaccine safety surveillance justified as Earlier Noted, ebizuuliddwa biraga nti abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baawulira nnyo nti okulondoola obukuumi bw’eddagala erigema okukola tekulina kugenda mu maaso kwokka okusukka pulojekiti eno mu mpeereza y’ebyobulamu eya bulijjo, naye era egenda ekula okutuuka ku ndala ."
"They strongly noted that such a safety surveillance activity is very relevant as it enables the needed understanding of vaccine efficacy, and peoples illegibility and safety given the increase in vaccine technology and products.","Baategeezezza nnyo nti omulimu ng’ogwo ogw’okulondoola obukuumi gukwatagana nnyo kuba gusobozesa okutegeera okwetaagisa ku bulung’amu bw’okugema, n’obutabeera mu mateeka n’obukuumi bw’abantu okusinziira ku tekinologiya n’ebintu ebigema okweyongera."
"They emphasized that as long as there are new vaccines, there is need to keep a track of what is happening to be able to support both learning and early preparations of the health workers, but also feedback to the community as their feelings about one vaccine can impact any vaccine, overall.","Bakikkaatiriza nti kasita wabaawo eddagala erigema eppya, waliwo obwetaavu okulondoola ebigenda mu maaso okusobola okuwagira byombi okuyiga n’okuteekateeka nga bukyali abakozi b’ebyobulamu, naye era n’okuddibwamu eri ekitundu ng’enneewulira zaabwe ku ddagala erimu liyinza okukosa eddagala lyonna erigema, okutwaliza awamu."
"Such consequences can have a backsliding effect on all the efforts of promoting vaccines, thus leaving communities unprotected.","Ebivaamu ng’ebyo bisobola okuba n’ekikolwa eky’okudda emabega ku kaweefube yenna ow’okutumbula eddagala erigema, bwe kityo ne kireka ebitundu nga tebirina bukuumi."
"We need it because through surveillance, we can see the efficacy of the vaccine, and what may happen, and people who could be eligible.","Tukyetaaga kubanga okuyita mu kulondoola, tusobola okulaba obulungi bw’eddagala erigema, n’ebiyinza okubaawo, n’abantu abayinza okuba n’ebisaanyizo."
It is very necessary to scale it up.,Kyetaagisa nnyo okukikulaakulanya.
"It is key [ Timely adverse events tracking is easier than retrospective approaches: In their justification for scale up, participants stressed the importance of focusing on ensuring that the vaccine safety surveillance is started on time/earlier stages of vaccination in order not to miss any cases.","Kikulu [ okulondoola ebizibu mu budde kyangu okusinga enkola ez’okudda emabega: Mu nsonga yazo ey’okugerageranya, abeetabye mu kugezesebwa bakkaatiriza obukulu bw’okussa essira ku kulaba ng’okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema kutandikibwa ku mitendera egy’ekiseera/okusooka egy’okugema okusobola obutasubwa misango gyonna."
"They noted that scaling up the HBSSS activities, offers an opportunity to avoid most challenges of delayed protocol development and approval, delayed surveillance and reliance on the retrospective approach which, based on their experience and lessons from this HBSSS project, they reported was a bit difficult to implement.","Bategeezezza nti okulinnyisa emirimu gya HBSSS, kiwa omukisa okwewala okusoomoozebwa okusinga obungi okw’okulwawo okukola enkola n’okukkiriza, okulondoola n’okwesigamira ku nkola ey’okudda emabega nga okusinziira ku bumanyirivu bwabwe n’eby’okuyiga okuva mu pulojekiti eno eya HBSSS, baategeeza nti kyali kizibu katono okussa mu nkola."
Iwould think if there is plan of introduction of any new vaccine it starts early enough because retrospective data collection is very challenging and also approval of protocol usually takes time because we had a challenge when the HBSSS was approved vaccination had already gone down [National].,Iwould think singa wabaawo plan of introduction of any new vaccine it starts early enough kubanga retrospective data collection is very challenging era era okukkiriza protocol kitera okutwala obudde kubanga twafuna okusoomoozebwa nga HBSSS yakkirizibwa okugema kwali kwagenda dda wansi [national].
Controlling vaccine hesitancy An opportunity to control for vaccine hesitancy was reported as one of the important benefits that scaling up active and timely surveillance brings to the health system.,Okufuga okubuusabuusa okugema omukisa okufuga okubuusabuusa okugema kyaloopebwa ng’ekimu ku birungi ebikulu okulinnyisa okulondoola okukola era mu budde kwe kuleeta mu nkola y’ebyobulamu.
"Participants noted that although it requires extensive resources, the active surveillance is relevant in advancing benefits, access and coverage of vaccines by reducing the negative influences of vaccine hesitancy.","Abeetabye mu kutendekebwa kuno baategeezezza nti wadde nga kyetaagisa eby’obugagga ebingi, okulondoola okukola kukwatagana mu kutumbula emigaso, okufuna n’okubikka ku ddagala erigema nga kikendeeza ku buzibu obuva mu kugema okubuusabuusa."
"The study lessons showed that rampant hesitancy was partly attributed to lack of such vaccine safety surveillance activities that when conducted not only create a sense of patient care (when they are followed up), but also promotes knowledge, and trust in the vaccines.","Emisomo gy’okunoonyereza gyalaga nti okubuusabuusa okuyitiridde ekitundu kyateekebwa ku butabeera na mirimu egy’okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema egy’engeri eno nga bwe gikolebwa tegikoma ku kutondawo kutegeera kwa balwadde (bwe gigobererwa), naye era kitumbula okumanya, n’okwesiga eddagala erigema."
"Some of the participants strongly advised that there should not be any vaccination (because it would be not useful), if there cant be active safety surveillance for it to generate evidence that not only improve vaccines safety, but also the related population confidence.","Abamu ku beetabye mu kugezesebwa baawa amagezi nnyo nti tewali kugema kwonna (kubanga tekyandibadde kya mugaso), singa tewabaawo kulondoola kwa bukuumi kwa maanyi okusobola okuleeta obujulizi obutakoma ku kulongoosa bukuumi bw’okugema, wabula n’obwesige bw’abantu obukwatagana."
"As NDA, MOH or as government, we always call people lets vaccinate, but after vaccinating we dont follow them up, people continue to see that no one is following them up and that increases vaccine hesitancy especially for the new vaccines [National].","Nga NDA, MOH oba nga gavumenti, bulijjo abantu tubayita okugema, naye oluvannyuma lw’okugema tetubagoberera, abantu basigala balaba nti tewali abigoberera era ekyo kyongera okubuusabuusa naddala ku ddagala eppya erigema [eggwanga]."
For the first time that you have almost 8 Regional Referral vaccine.,Omulundi ogusooka nga olina kumpi 8 regional referral vaccine.
"Well, the vaccines are safe, but the safety component has not been included so much 2) patients appreciate when you follow them up a parent on active surveillance, feel cared for when you call them","Well, eddagala erigemebwa teririna bulabe, naye ekitundu ky’obukuumi tekiyingiziddwaamu nnyo 2) abalwadde basiima bw’obagoberera omuzadde ku kulondoola okukola, wulira ng’olabirirwa ng’obayita ."
Because all you know is that the adverse event may end up making more people not take up the vaccine....a big part of them because of fears and worries.,Kubanga kyokka ky'omanyi nti ekintu ekibi kiyinza okumaliriza nga kifudde abantu bangi obutamira ddagala....ekitundu ekinene ku bo olw'okutya n'okweraliikirira.
"The recommendations were related to ensuring sustainability of the gains, from the HBSSS project which were related to the need for improvements in human resources, capacity building, health data infrastructure, coordination and monitoring, budgeting/funding.","Ebiteeso byali byekuusa ku kulaba ng’amagoba gawangaazi, okuva mu pulojekiti ya HBSSS eyali ekwatagana n’obwetaavu bw’okulongoosa mu bakozi, okuzimba obusobozi, ebikozesebwa mu by’obulamu, okukwasaganya n’okulondoola, okukola embalirira/ensimbi."
"Overall, scaling up the HBSS project activities into routine services was expected to ensure surveillance of all vaccines safety in a timely manner (and not long after the vaccination program begins).","Okutwaliza awamu, okulinnyisa emirimu gya pulojekiti ya HBSS mu mpeereza eya bulijjo kyali kisuubirwa okukakasa okulondoola obukuumi bwonna obw’okugema mu budde (era nga tewannayita bbanga ddene nga enteekateeka y’okugema etandika)."
"The scaling up requires several factors to be developed or addressed as described in the following subheadings: Orient other health facilities In relation to scaling up, other health facilities that were not involved in the study would require adequate orientation on what is involved and the implications (in time of benefits and resources involved).","Okulinnyisa ensonga kyetaagisa ensonga eziwerako okukolebwa oba okutunulwamu nga bwe kinyonyoddwa mu mitwe emitono gino wammanga: Okulungamya ebifo ebirala eby’obulamu mu bikwatagana n’okulinnyisa, ebifo ebirala eby’obulamu ebitakwatibwako mu kunoonyereza byandibadde byetaaga okulungamya okumala ku ebyo ebizingirwamu n’ebivaamu (mu kiseera ky’emigaso n’ebikozesebwa ebizingirwamu)."
"It is important to scale up because not all cases that we receive were vaccinated from here, we work from Eastern Region, Elgon zone, where we serve about 14 districts and one city.","Kikulu okulinnyisa omutindo kubanga si misango gyonna gye tufuna nti gyagemebwa okuva wano, tukola okuva mu Eastern Region, Elgon Zone, gye tuweereza disitulikiti nga 14 n’ekibuga kimu."
"We could spot some health facilities with a bit much population and go and orient them on what is happening on vaccine efficacy and hesitancy, and how to health educate the clients when they come [Records.","Tuyinza okulaba ebifo ebimu eby’obulamu nga tulina omuwendo omungi ennyo ne tugenda ne tubalungamya ku bigenda mu maaso ku bulungibwansi bw’okugema n’okubuusabuusa, n’engeri y’obulamu okusomesa bakasitoma nga bajja [ebikwata."
Empower frontline workers: Participants indicated a strong need to develop/strengthen human resource in charge of the active vaccine safety surveillance.,Abakozi abawa amaanyi mu maaso: Abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baalaga obwetaavu obw’amaanyi obw’okukulaakulanya/okunyweza abakozi abavunaanyizibwa ku kulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema okukola.
"They should be able to take samples, fill the forms, building the capacity of the health care workers at the who are managing these people, those are the ones whose capacity need to be built [National].","Balina okusobola okutwala sampuli, okujjuza foomu, okuzimba obusobozi bw’abakozi b’ebyobulamu mu WHO abaddukanya abantu bano, abo be basobola okuzimbibwa [eggwanga]."
"While there may be some capacity, its not strong enough for us to be fully confident in our vaccine safety effortsbecause people will say; this is extra work.","Wadde nga wayinza okubaawo obusobozi obumu, its not strong enough for us to be fully confident in our vaccine safety afforssaba abantu bajja kugamba; Guno mulimu gwa kwongerako."
"So, Ithink there is a need for the MOH to consider this since it is a new component.","Kale, ithink waliwo obwetaavu Moh okulowooza ku kino okuva bwe kiri nti kitundu kipya."
"Someone should be hired for this particular work, not as an additionaland that recommendation should really come out clearly [National].","Omuntu alina okupangisibwa olw’omulimu guno ogw’enjawulo, so si nga eky’okwongerako era okuteesa okwo ddala kulina okuvaayo mu ngeri entegeerekeka [eggwanga]."
"Additionally, sometimes people think they need to be compensated for damages or other related issues, but we dont have the Refresher and other courses are needed Refresher courses were another key issue that study participants raised concerning efforts to ensure scale up of surveillance.","Okugatta ku ekyo, oluusi abantu balowooza nti beetaaga okuliyirirwa olw’okwonoonebwa oba ensonga endala ezikwatagana, naye we dont have the refresher era emisomo emirala gyetaagibwa emisomo egy’okuzzaamu amaanyi gyali nsonga ndala nkulu abeetabye mu kunoonyereza kwe baaleeta ku kaweefube w’okukakasa nti okulondoola okulinnyisa."
"Iwould say more trainings should be conducted because it was conducted at the beginning, and this was a 2- year project.","Nze ngenda kugamba nti emisomo mingi girina okukolebwa kubanga gyakolebwa ku ntandikwa, era eno yali pulojekiti ya myaka 2."
"You are engaged in other activities so you find you might have used other criteria, so at least there should have been another training in between [Laboratory].","Oli mu mirimu emirala kale osanga oyinza okuba nga wakozesa emisingi emirala, kale waakiri wandibaddewo okutendekebwa okulala wakati [laboratory]."
Idont think they missed out anything except the fact that the project has taken about 2 years.,Sirowooza nti baasubwa ekintu kyonna okuggyako nti pulojekiti eno etwalidde emyaka nga 2.
"They would have only added like a refresher course along the way to bring peoples minds back because some of the cases were really rare like you dont even see them at times so when they get like one, if you not up to date, you might miss out [Medical Doctor].","Bandiyongeddeko nga refresher course mu kkubo okuzza peoples minds kubanga ezimu ku cases ddala zaali rare like you dont even see them at times kale bwebafuna nga emu, singa toba up to date, oyinza okusubwa [Medical Doctor]."
"Iwould recommend a continuous training, if you have done initial training then maybe as the evaluation is going on, like after four months, and six months [National].","Nze nkuwa amagezi okutendekebwa okutambula obutasalako, singa oba okoze okutendekebwa okusooka olwo mpozzi nga okwekenneenya bwe kugenda mu maaso, nga oluvannyuma lw’emyezi ena, n’emyezi mukaaga [eggwanga]."
Training duration that provides extended/adequate training days were recommended.,Obudde bw’okutendekebwa obuwa ennaku z’okutendekebwa ezigaziyiziddwa/ezimala byasemba.
"Specifically, it was recommended that refresher courses and other training such as the one that was conducted at the start of","Okusingira ddala, kyalagirwa nti emisomo egy’okuzzaamu amaanyi n’okutendekebwa okulala ng’ogwo ogwakolebwa ku ntandikwa y’"
They described the training in the HBSSS project as rushed and felt that it would have been good if the training days were extended to ensure more room for the comprehensive material and diseases that were discussed.,Bano bannyonnyodde okutendekebwa mu pulojekiti ya HBSSS nga kwafubutuka era ne bawulira nti kyandibadde kirungi singa ennaku z’okutendekebwa zigaziyizibwa okukakasa ekifo ekisingawo ku bintu ebijjuvu n’endwadde ebyayogerwako.
"With 13 ESIs, going through extensive content in just four days, it might have been beneficial to extend the duration slightly.","Nga olina ESIS 13, okuyita mu bintu ebingi mu nnaku nnya zokka, kiyinza okuba nga kyali kya mugaso okwongerako katono ebbanga."
"The content covered was substantial, and there was a lot to learn in a limited time [National].","Ebirimu ebyakwatibwako byali bingi, era nga waliwo bingi eby’okuyiga mu kiseera ekigere [eggwanga]."
Findings indicated a need for a multidisciplinary approach to vaccine safety surveillance to ensure that all the required perspectives are considered across a whole surveillance chain in future.,Ebizuuliddwa byalaga obwetaavu bw’enkola ey’enjawulo ey’okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema okukakasa nti endowooza zonna ezeetaagisa zitunuulirwa mu lujegere lwonna olw’okulondoola mu biseera eby’omu maaso.
"For instance, there were suggestions for consideration of the legal, media and the social science expertise on the surveillance team.","Ng’ekyokulabirako, waaliwo ebiteeso eby’okulowooza ku by’amateeka, emikutu gy’amawulire n’obukugu mu ssaayansi w’obulamu ku ttiimu y’okulondoola."
A legal expert would offer the necessary support for dealing with the evolving legal issues that may arise along the adverse events in relation to vaccines.,Omukugu mu by’amateeka yandiwadde obuwagizi obwetaagisa okukola ku nsonga z’amateeka ezigenda zikulaakulana eziyinza okuvaayo ku bikolwa eby’obuzibu ebikwata ku kugema.
It was suggested that such expertise could be incorporated in an ad-hoc manner working closely with the lead stakeholders.,Kyateesebwa nti obukugu obwo busobola okuyingizibwa mu ngeri ey’ekiseera nga bakolagana bulungi n’abakulembeze abakulembeze.
"Iknow we have had support from the MOH - UNEPI and the AGs office to address those issues, but Ithink in future, we may have a stand-by legal team that can always help us.","iKnow Tubadde n'obuwagizi okuva mu MOH - UNEPI ne AGS Office okukola ku nsonga ezo, naye ithink mu maaso, tuyinza okuba ne ttiimu y'amateeka eyimiridde bulijjo esobola okutuyamba bulijjo."
We may need in the future to also have maybe a communications team because those have been our biggest weaknesses.,Tuyinza okwetaaga mu biseera eby’omu maaso era okuba ne ttiimu y’empuliziganya mpozzi kubanga ebyo bye bibadde obunafu bwaffe obusinga obunene.
"We need to communicate better, have better funding, and then maybe the legal issues around vaccines.","Tulina okuwuliziganya obulungi, okuba n’ensimbi ezisingako, olwo mpozzi ensonga z’amateeka ezeetoolodde okugema."
Because these issues keep evolving [ Improve data infrastructure / capacity at health facilities Participants felt that scaling up requires building a resilient surveillance system that has highly improved data management tools and processes including considerations for digital data systems.,Olw’okuba ensonga zino zisigala nga zikyukakyuka [ okulongoosa enkola ya data / obusobozi mu bifo by’ebyobulamu abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baawulira nti okulinnyisa omutindo kyetaagisa okuzimba enkola y’okulondoola egumira embeera erongooseddwa ennyo ebikozesebwa n’enkola z’okuddukanya amawulire omuli n’okulowooza ku nkola za data za digito.
"Besides, going digital, participants recommended that the data collection and management system should be built with adequate capacity to not only enable automated processes, but also both retrospective and prospective case Ithink we need to train people better and then to put in place resilient systems to collect data on adverse events and may be going digital.","Ng’oggyeeko ekyo, okugenda mu dijitwali, abeetabye mu kutendekebwa kuno baawa amagezi nti enkola y’okukung’aanya n’okuddukanya amawulire erina okuzimbibwa n’obusobozi obumala obutakoma ku kusobozesa nkola za otomatiki, naye era byombi eby’okudda emabega n’ebisuubirwa ITHINK twetaaga okutendeka abantu obulungi n’oluvannyuma okuteekawo enkola ezigumira embeera okukung’aanya amawulire ku bikolwa eby’obubi era tuyinza okuba nga bigenda mu dijitwali."
"Ithink that would be a good thing and having resilient mechanisms to collect data on any events that may occur [ the proper filling of the primary data collection tools needs to be highly improved and the improvement should be capturing all the data about these cases, any patient, regardless of being a case or not, because anybody may have interest about a given condition at a certain timeso the primary data collection tool should have all the details of this patientthe telephone numbers, next of kin contacts, so that it helps us in follow up and contact tracing [National].","Ithink that would be a good thing and having resilient mechanisms to collect data on any events that may occur [ the proper filling of the primary data collection tools needs to be highly improved and the improvement should be capturing all the data about these cases, any patient, regardless of being a case or not, because anybody may have interest about a given condition at a certain timeso the primary data collection tool should have all the details of this patientthe telephone numbers, next of kin contacts, so that it helps us in follow up and contact okulondoola [eggwanga]."
All participants strongly felt that improved data management system in which both quantitative and qualitative data expertise is adequate would be key in making data/evidence informed decisions and effectively communicating the risks and benefits of vaccines to the public.,Bonna abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baawulira nnyo nti enkola y’okuddukanya amawulire erongooseddwamu nga obukugu bw’ebikwata ku bungi n’omutindo (quantitative and qualitative data expertise) bumala kyandibadde kikulu mu kusalawo ebikwata ku bantu/obujulizi mu ngeri entuufu n’okumanyisa obulungi obulabe n’emigaso gy’okugema abantu.
"Further emphasizing the need for better data systems, they indicated that such efforts should include those focused on building a system that is not only of high quality to deliver credible data, but also user friendly to enable its effective use.","Okwongera okuggumiza obwetaavu bw’enkola za data ennungi, baalaga nti kaweefube ng’oyo alina okussaamu abo abassa essira ku kuzimba enkola etali ya mutindo gwa waggulu gwokka okutuusa data eyesigika, wabula n’okukozesa obulungi abakozesa okusobozesa okukozesa obulungi."
"For instance, they described how use of the SPT forms could potentially not improve the quality of the current project data.","Okugeza, bannyonnyola engeri enkozesa ya ffoomu za SPT gye ziyinza obutalongoosa mutindo gwa data ya pulojekiti eriwo kati."
So those are the areas we need to improve on [Team Leader].,Kale ebyo bye bitundu bye twetaaga okulongoosa [omukulembeze wa ttiimu].
"Based on the lessons from the HBSSS project implementation in line with ensuring that the necessary data is available and credible, some participants emphasized the need for data/investigation protocols.","Okusinziira ku by’okuyiga okuva mu kuteeka mu nkola pulojekiti ya HBSSS nga bikwatagana n’okukakasa nti data eyetaagisa eriwo era eyesigika, abamu ku beetabye mu kugezesebwa baaggumiza obwetaavu bw’enkola z’okunoonyereza/okunoonyereza."
They recommended that such protocols and guidelines should be comprehensive including aspects of herbal medicines (which is used by a significant fraction of the population in the country) in relation to vaccines.,Baawa amagezi nti ebiragiro n’ebiragiro ng’ebyo birina okuba nga bijjuvu omuli ebitundu by’eddagala ly’ebimera (ebikozesebwa ekitundu ekinene eky’abantu mu ggwanga) mu bikwatagana n’okugema.
Findings indicated that the generation and utilization of credible data is key in building community trust and improved vaccination program through increased vaccination coverage as well as costs.,Ebizuuliddwa biraga nti okuzaala n’okukozesa ebikwata ku bantu abeesigika kikulu nnyo mu kuzimba obwesige bw’abantu n’enteekateeka y’okugema erongooseddwa nga bayita mu kwongera okugema okusasulwa awamu n’ebisale.
It is important to keep the stakeholders well informed and share routine gaps that can be identified early enough so that remedial actions are put in place before escalating to a higher amount or higher level.,Kikulu okukuuma abakwatibwako nga bamanyi bulungi n‟okugabana ebituli ebya bulijjo ebiyinza okuzuulibwa nga bukyali ekimala ebikolwa eby‟okutereeza biteekebwewo nga tebinnaba kweyongera ku muwendo gwa waggulu oba ogw‟oku ntikko.
Early stakeholder engagement is key in ensure that priorities among stakeholder are harmonised and efforts and resources consolidated to adequately offer support to the process.,Okukwatagana n‟abakwatibwako nga bukyali kikulu nnyo mu kulaba nti ebikulu ebirina okukulembezebwa mu bakwatibwako bikwatagana era kaweefube n‟ebikozesebwa binywezeddwa okusobola okuwa obuwagizi mu ngeri emala.
"Ithink for any program really the planning has to be adequate, even time and ensuring mobilizing stakeholders, if there are any delays it could have been from the competing priorities from the stakeholders","Ithink for any programme ddala enteekateeka erina okuba emala, wadde obudde n’okukakasa okukungaanya abakwatibwako, singa wabaawo okulwawo kwonna kwandibadde okuva mu bikulu ebivuganya okuva mu bakwatibwako ."
"It was recommended that future engagements should include not only the technical arm, but also the media which reports indicated were largely missing.","Kyateesebwa nti okugattibwa mu biseera eby’omu maaso tekulina kuzingiramu mukono gwa tekinologiya gwokka, wabula n’emikutu gy’amawulire egyali giraga nti okusinga gyabula."
"Ithink that maybe we need to have the stakeholders at the national level in the scientific technical part and then the general part which includes a wider spectrum of stakeholders including lay people and the media, so that they can have an idea about this surveillance, and Ithink also And the other one that was missing which Iremember very well was media.","Ithink nti mpozzi twetaaga okuba n’abakwatibwako ku mutendera gw’eggwanga mu kitundu kya sayansi eky’ekikugu n’oluvannyuma ekitundu eky’awamu ekirimu ekibinja ekinene eky’abakwatibwako omuli abalayiki n’abamawulire, basobole okuba n’ekirowoozo ku kulondoola kuno, ne ithink era n’omulala eyali ebulamu Iremember ennyo yali mikutu gya mawulire."

Provide for and implement community engagement Community is one of the key stakeholders in vaccine safety surveillance.,Okuwa n‟okussa mu nkola ekitundu ky‟okukwatagana n‟abantu b‟omukitundu kye kimu ku bikulu ebikwatibwako mu kulondoola obukuumi bw‟okugema.
"Engaging the local structures and the public for instance through continuous education of communities about the vaccines including side effects is key in addressing the challenges related to misinformation, rumours and fears among the public.","Okuyingiza ensengeka z’ekitundu n’abantu okugeza nga bayita mu kusomesa ebitundu ebitasalako ku ddagala erigema omuli n’ebizibu ebivaamu kikulu nnyo mu kukola ku kusoomoozebwa okukwata ku mawulire amakyaamu, ebigambo n’okutya mu bantu."
This was based on a key example in the participants perception that vaccine regulation component was not given the priority and funds it required; a challenged that they felt stem beyond this HBSSS project to routine vaccine programs.,Kino kyali kyesigamiziddwa ku kyokulabirako ekikulu mu ndowooza y’abeetabye nti ekitundu ky’okulungamya eddagala erigema tekyaweebwa kukulembeza na nsimbi kye kyali kyetaagisa; A challenged nti bawulira nga basibuka okusukka pulojekiti eno eya HBSSS okutuuka ku pulogulaamu z’okugema eza bulijjo.
"There is a need to have a mechanism of how to continuously support the surveillance activities at all levels including prioritizing regulatory perspectives in all processes including systems and tools for monitoring, supervision and funding/resource mobilisation.","Waliwo obwetaavu bw’okuba n’enkola y’engeri y’okuwagira obutasalako emirimu gy’okulondoola ku mitendera gyonna omuli okukulembeza endowooza z’abafuga mu nkola zonna omuli enkola n’ebikozesebwa mu kulondoola, okulondoola n’okusonda ensimbi/okukungaanya eby’obugagga."
"Conduct continuous supervision and monitoring Besides the recommendation for improvements in the safety surveillance team, participants indicated a strong need for continuous support supervision, monitoring and evaluation in order to effectively implement, continuously monitor and improve the quality of the process and outcomes.","Okukola okulondoola n‟okulondoola obutasalako Ng‟oggyeeko okuteesa ku nnongoosereza mu ttiimu y‟okulondoola obukuumi, abeetabye mu kutendekebwa baalaga obwetaavu obw‟amaanyi obw‟okulabirira obuyambi obutasalako, okulondoola n‟okwekenneenya okusobola okussa mu nkola obulungi, okulondoola obutasalako n‟okulongoosa omutindo gw‟enkola n‟ebivaamu."
"It is important to however note that while this projects supervision was rated high but majority, a few participants had concerns on some inadequacies in the supervision process.","Kikulu wabula okukimanya nti wadde nga kino okulondoola pulojekiti kwaweebwa ekipimo kya waggulu naye ekisinga obungi, abatono abeetabye mu kugezesebwa baalina okweraliikirira ku butali butuukirivu obumu mu nkola y‟okulabirira."
"One of the participants at national level noted; the support supervision, Ifelt it was not enough, we did like only two support supervision, but Ithink people need to be followed up to see what they are doing.","Omu ku beetabye ku mutendera gw’eggwanga yategeezezza nti; Okulabirira obuwagizi, Ifelt tekyamala, twakola nga okulabirira obuwagizi bubiri bwokka, naye ithink abantu beetaaga okugobererwa okulaba kyebakola."
"They said that supervision should cover not only the staff performance, but also the cold chain and related logistics for vaccine programs to ensure that they are up to date and standard.","Baagambye nti okulabirira tekulina kukola ku nkola y’abakozi yokka, wabula n’olujegere lw’ennyogovu n’enteekateeka ezikwatagana n’enteekateeka z’okugema okulaba nga ziri ku mulembe n’omutindo."
"They also noted that the supervision system/process should also particularly focus on ensuring that there is adequate support to ensure that the simple and user-friendly surveillance tools and data bases are not only available, but accessible and properly used by relevant stakeholders.","Bano era bategeezezza nti enkola/enkola y’okulabirira nayo erina okussa essira naddala ku kulaba nga waliwo obuwagizi obumala okukakasa nti ebikozesebwa eby’okulondoola ebyangu era ebiyamba abakozesa n’ebifo eby’amawulire tebikoma ku kubeerawo, wabula bituukirirwa era bikozesebwa bulungi abakwatibwako abakwatibwako."
Such tools should be digital and designed to have all the needed information that is.,Ebikozesebwa ng’ebyo birina okuba nga bya digito era nga bikoleddwa okuba n’amawulire gonna ageetaagisa.
"The coordinators of the project should try to liaise with the MOH team in charge of the EPIVACsuch that it would be easy for us to access the vaccination status, if at all its there in the system, such that we would have more cases brought on board.","Abakwanaganya pulojekiti eno balina okugezaako okukwatagana ne ttiimu ya MOH evunaanyizibwa ku Epivacsuch nti kyandibadde kyangu gye tuli okutuuka ku mbeera y’okugema, singa mu nkola yaayo yonna eyo mu nkola, nga twandibadde n’emisango mingi egyaleetebwa ku lyato."
"Yes, that was a major challenge.","Yee, ekyo kyali kusoomoozebwa kwa maanyi."
An example of integration by some countries in a similar setting of the low- and middle-income countries was highlighted.,Ekyokulabirako ky’okwegatta kw’amawanga agamu mu mbeera efaananako n’eyo ey’amawanga agalina ssente entono n’eza wakati kyalagibwa.
Iam aware that some low- and middle-income countries have tried to integrate such programs into their,Iam aware nti amawanga agamu agafuna ssente entono n’aga wakati gagezezzaako okugatta pulogulaamu ng’ezo mu .
Integration requires some level of investment and a change in mindset to ensure that these programs are seen as feasible and necessary [National].,Okugatta kwetaaga omutendera ogutali gumu ogw’okuteeka ssente n’okukyusa endowooza okukakasa nti pulogulaamu zino zitunuulirwa ng’ezisoboka era ezeetaagisa [eggwanga].
"Every involved in healthcare, must have a component of surveillance integrated into their work.","Buli yeenyigira mu by’obulamu, alina okuba n’ekitundu ky’okulondoola nga kiyingiziddwa mu mulimu gwabwe."
"Everyone should have it as their responsibility, from the nurse or the person doing triage to the Although integration could come with extra workload for health workers, and need for modification in the tools, it was perceived by many participants to be a best approach to scaling up active surveillance across the country.","Buli muntu alina okukifuna ng’obuvunaanyizibwa bwe, okuva ku nnansi oba omuntu akola triage okutuuka ku wadde okwegatta kuyinza okujja n’emirimu egy’enjawulo eri abakozi b’ebyobulamu, n’obwetaavu bw’okukyusa mu bikozesebwa, kyatwalibwa bangi abeetabye mu kugezesebwa okuba enkola esinga obulungi ey’okulinnyisa okulondoola ennyo okwetoloola eggwanga lyonna."
They believed that integration into routine services would ensure that active surveillance is conducted across all vaccines and not only a few of them that have either funding or specific support.,Baali balowooza nti okwegatta mu mpeereza eza bulijjo kyandikakasa nti okulondoola ennyo kukolebwa mu kugema kwonna so si kutono kwokka ku zo ezirina ensimbi oba obuwagizi obw’enjawulo.
"They also emphasized that integration should cut across all the process including actual implementation, supervision and monitoring as well as tools noting that the tools needed are developed by the HBSSS project already.","Era bakikkaatirizza nti okwegatta kulina okusala ku nkola zonna omuli okussa mu nkola entuufu, okulabirira n’okulondoola wamu n’ebikozesebwa okwetegereza nti ebikozesebwa ebyetaagisa bikolebwa pulojekiti ya HBSSS edda."
"Integration of course our human resources is limited, Ithink anyone who has looked at our system and has looked at the staffing knows there is a huge gap, there is an issue when it comes to human resources, but Ithink integration is critical because if the focus becomes on one disease, then that becomes an issue we maintain the elements, we integrate it in our plans, our workload systems whether its supervision, whether its reviewing the data, supporting the tools because we are now actually going towards digital for a lot of our surveillance work, its just integrating in our current workload [National].","Integration of course our human resources is limited, Ithink anyone who has looked at our system and has looked at the staffing knows there is a huge gap, there is an issue when it comes to human resources, but Ithink integration is critical because if the focus becomes on one disease, then that becomes an issue we maintain the elements, we integrate it in our plans, our workload systems whether its supervision, whether its reviewing the data, supporting the tools because we are now actually going towards digital for a lot of our surveillance work, its just integrating mu mulimu gwaffe oguliwo kati [eggwanga]."
A further in put by stakeholders in put in form of dissemination meetings was suggested by one participant as one of the key beginning steps to further get their input into the best possibilities of continuity in an integrative way for active surveillance.,A further in put by stakeholders in put in form of dissemination meetings was suggested by one participant as one of the key beginning steps okwongera okufuna ebiteeso byabwe mu busobozi obusinga obulungi obw’okugenda mu maaso mu ngeri ey’okugatta okulondoola okukola.
"Instead of centralizing everything in one location, like Lagos, we should have regional perspectives and learningsfrom the learnings of this study, we should be able to inform specific regions on how to handle these issues, including communication strategies.","Mu kifo ky’okussa buli kimu mu kifo ekimu mu kifo kimu, nga Lagos, tusaanidde okuba n’endowooza z’ekitundu n’okuyiga okuva mu kuyiga kw’okunoonyereza kuno, tusaanidde okusobola okumanyisa ebitundu ebitongole ku ngeri y’okukwatamu ensonga zino, omuli n’obukodyo bw’empuliziganya."
Establish regional causality assessment committees Decentralisation would mean that the causality assessment is conducted at the regional level instead of only national level which would however require that the regional committees are trained and equipped with technical knowledge for the task.,Okuteekawo obukiiko obukebera ensonga z’ebitundu (regional causality assessment committees) Okugabanya obuyinza mu bitundu kyanditegeeza nti okukebera ensonga eziviirako kukolebwa ku mutendera gw’ekitundu mu kifo ky’omutendera gw’eggwanga gwokka naye nga kyetaagisa obukiiko bw’ebitundu okutendekebwa era ne buweebwa okumanya okw’ekikugu olw’omulimu.
"Besides ensuring that the regional perspectives are considered, regionalisation could result in timely causality assessment and risk communication (that is reduced delays","Ng’oggyeeko okukakasa nti endowooza z’ekitundu zilowoozebwako, okutwala ebitundu mu kitundu kiyinza okuvaamu okwekenneenya ensonga eziviirako n’empuliziganya mu budde (kwe kukendeeza ku kulwawo ."
"This would ensure that the regional team are as competent as the national team, with the only difference being the level at which they operate.","Kino kyandikakasa nti ttiimu y’ekitundu erina obusobozi nga ttiimu y’eggwanga, ng’enjawulo yokka y’eddaala lye bakolera."
"You would know the outcome earlier, which would allow for timely responses, such as implementing risk communicationcurrently, if causality assessment takes three months due to data challenges and back-and-forth communication, it can delay the entire process, affecting the program and other related activities.","Wanditegedde ebinaavaamu emabegako, ekyandisobozesezza okuddamu mu budde, gamba ng’okussa mu nkola empuliziganya y’akabi mu kiseera kino, singa okwekenneenya ensonga eziviirako kutwala emyezi esatu olw’okusoomoozebwa kwa data n’empuliziganya y’okudda emabega n’okudda emabega, kiyinza okulwawo enkola yonna, okukosa enteekateeka n’emirimu emirala egyekuusa ku nsonga eno."
"The capacity should be the same to ensure that decisions made at the regional level, like in Karamoja, are not challenged elsewhere.","Obusobozi bulina okuba bwe bumu okulaba nti okusalawo okukoleddwa ku mutendera gw’ekitundu, nga mu Karamoja, tekusoomoozebwa awalala."
"It should meet international standards, but it would be beneficial to have this structure in place [National].","Kisaanye okutuukiriza omutindo gw’ensi yonna, naye kyandibadde kya mugaso okuba n’ensengeka eno mu kifo [eggwanga]."
"So, it should be extended to all throughout the health system [ recommend that we expand the number of sites and go to lower-level sites, not only Regional Referrals none of us prefer to go the Regional Referral, you only go there when things are bad so Iwould think in future protocols, they should think of representatives in the health centre 3 and 4 and general Invest in risk communication Participants believed that the financial investment for active safety surveillance activities should be accompanied by an investment in risk communication and feedback which is central in proving the community with the right information.","Kale, kisaana okugaziyizibwa eri bonna mu nkola yonna ey’ebyobulamu [ okuteesa nti tugaziye omuwendo gw’ebifo ne tugenda mu bifo eby’omutendera ogwa wansi, si kusindikibwa mu bitundu kwokka Tewali n’omu ku ffe ayagala kugenda mu kitundu okusindikibwa mu kitundu, ogendayo byokka ng’ebintu bibi kale iwould think in future protocols, they should think of representatives in the health center 3 and 4 and general invest in risk participties nga mulimu amawulire amatuufu."
They noted that this requires a strategic plan informed by the understanding that presence (or lack of) vaccine safety surveillance information sharing can affect immunization programs at the national level.,Baategeezezza nti kino kyetaagisa enteekateeka ey’obukodyo etegeezebwa okutegeera nti okubeerawo (oba obutabaawo) kugabana ku bukuumi bw’okugema amawulire kuyinza okukosa enteekateeka z’okugema ku mutendera gw’eggwanga.
"They emphasized the proactive measures including risk communication should therefore be put in place in a way that covers comprehensively both current issues and those that are likely to happen, considering upcoming vaccines like the malaria vaccine, which will also present adverse vaccine safety issues including the rampant misinformation.","Bassa essira ku nkola ezisookerwako omuli empuliziganya y’akabi n’olwekyo zirina okuteekebwawo mu ngeri ekwata ku nsonga zombi eziriwo kati n’ezo eziyinza okubaawo, okulowooza ku ddagala erigema erigenda okugema omusujja gw’ensiri, era nga kino nakyo kigenda kuleeta ensonga z’obukuumi bw’okugema obubi omuli n’okubunyisa amawulire amakyaamu."

Risk communication should follow once we have identified and understood,Empuliziganya ey’akabi erina okugoberera nga tumaze okuzuula era ne tutegeera .
Another recommendation was related to sustainability measures as detailed in the section on [Sustainability Mechanisms for Active Safety Surveillance Benefits Need Improvement].,Ekiteeso ekirala kyali kikwatagana n‟ebipimo by‟okuyimirizaawo nga bwe kirambikiddwa mu kitundu ku [Enkola z‟okuyimirizaawo emigaso egy‟okulondoola obukuumi egy‟amaanyi gyetaaga okulongoosaamu].
Sustainability mechanisms for active safety surveillance benefits need improvement Enhance existing sustainability efforts The national level participants reported that capacity building and sustainability considerations were embedded in the project activities and design.,Enkola z’okuyimirizaawo emigaso gy’okulondoola obukuumi obw’amaanyi gyetaaga okulongoosaamu okutumbula kaweefube w’okuyimirizaawo aliwo Abaabwe abeetabye mu kuyimirizaawo eggwanga baategeeza nti okuzimba obusobozi n’okulowooza ku kuyimirizaawo kwateekebwa mu mirimu gya pulojekiti n’okukola dizayini.
It was also stated that sustainability issues were also discussed during various review and initial meetings with stakeholders.,Era kyategeezeddwa nti ensonga z’okuyimirizaawo nazo zaateesebwako mu kwekenneenya okw’enjawulo n’enkiiko ezisooka n’abakwatibwako.
"Relatedly, most national level participants felt that sustainability was assured given that the key foundations were set including the fact that the project team was not entirely newly hired, but rather part of the why we are saying that sustainability can be carried on, we have not employed any external person in the sites...we have been relying on the staff within the capacity now well built and them having formed a team being led by the community and public health to continuity of such related studies [Director].","Mu ngeri ekwatagana, abasinga obungi ku mutendera gw’eggwanga baawulira nti okuyimirizaawo kwakakasibwa okusinziira ku kuba nti emisingi emikulu gyateekebwawo omuli n’okuba nti ttiimu ya pulojekiti teyali mpya ddala yapangisibwa, wabula ekitundu ku nsonga lwaki tugamba nti okuyimirizaawo kuyinza okukolebwa, tetukozesezza muntu yenna ow’ebweru mu bifo...tubadde twesigama ku bakozi abali mu bufuzi obw’engeri eyo]."
"Adequate financial investment in vaccine surveillance is needed The findings indicate that the scaling and integration process should ensure that a financial structure/ budget is in place to plan and detect vaccine related issues going forward, including prospectively identifying cases, conducting causal assessments, and public feedback or engagement.","Okuteeka ssente mu ngeri emala mu kulondoola eddagala erigema kyetaagisa ebizuuliddwa biraga nti enkola y’okugerageranya n’okugatta erina okukakasa nti ensengeka y’ebyensimbi/ embalirira eriwo okuteekateeka n’okuzuula ensonga ezikwata ku ddagala erigema okugenda mu maaso, omuli okusuubira okuzuula emisango, okukola okwekenneenya ensonga, n’okuddibwamu mu lujjudde oba okukwatagana."
"However, despite the reported considerations for capacity building and sustainability in the protocol in addition to the integration proposal by almost all participants, most of them were significantly worried and not confident about sustaining such programs especially in the low- and middle-income settings.","Naye, wadde nga waliwo okulowooza ku kuzimba obusobozi n‟okuyimirizaawo mu nkola eno nga kwotadde n‟ekiteeso ky‟okugatta kumpi bonna abeetabye, abasinga obungi ku bo baali beeraliikirira nnyo era nga si bwesige ku kuyimirizaawo pulogulaamu ng‟ezo naddala mu mbeera z‟ensimbi entono n‟eza wakati."
Most participants were largely sceptical about the sustainability of active safety surveillance in their indicated worry that the country lacks a laboratory infrastructure system that can offer the required diagnostic capacity/investigative capability for confirming the adverse events following vaccination.,Abasinga obungi abeetabye mu kugezesebwa kuno okusinga baali babuusabuusa ku buwangaazi bw‟okulondoola obukuumi obw‟amaanyi mu kweraliikirira kwabwe okulagiddwa nti eggwanga teririna nkola ya bikozesebwa mu laboratory esobola okuwa obusobozi obw‟okuzuula obulwadde obwetaagisa/obusobozi bw‟okunoonyereza okukakasa ebivaamu oluvannyuma lw‟okugema.
Idont know if we have the infrastructure that is adequate to do the diagnostic investigative part of the investigation.,Simanyi oba tulina infrastructure emala okukola diagnostic investigation ekitundu mu kunoonyereza.
"In general, maintaining such programs without ongoing donor support is challenging, especially in countries with high disease burdens and limited resources [National].","Okutwaliza awamu, okukuuma enteekateeka ng’ezo nga tewali buyambi bwa bagabi bwa mugabi obutasalako kizibu naddala mu nsi ezirina emigugu mingi egy’endwadde n’eby’obugagga ebitono [eggwanga]."
Most of the worry was associated to the perception that the surveillance process cannot largely be sustained for long if the HBSSS and related activities are totally dependent on external funding/donors.,Okusinga okweraliikirira kwali kukwatagana n‟endowooza nti enkola y‟okulondoola okusinga tesobola kuyimirizibwa okumala ebbanga eddene singa HBSSS n‟emirimu egyekuusa ku nsonga eno gyesigamye ddala ku nsimbi/abagaba ensimbi ez‟ebweru.
Their worries were based on the fact that the HBSSS project was specifically funded and not entirely streamlined within the routine/usual health facility service.,Okweraliikirira kwabwe kwasinziira ku kuba nti pulojekiti ya HBSSS yassibwamu ssente mu ngeri ey’enjawulo era nga teyalongooseddwa ddala mu mpeereza y’ebyobulamu eya bulijjo/eya bulijjo.
"Icannot give you an answer on how we shall do it because these people have been getting facilitation, some small enumerations which usually comes after every three months and now who is going to do it?","ICANNOT ekuwa eky'okuddamu ku ngeri gye tunaakikola kubanga abantu bano babadde bafuna facilitation, some small enumerations ezitera okujja oluvannyuma lwa buli myezi esatu era kati ani agenda okukikola?"
The support from CDC and WHO has been substantial.,Obuwagizi okuva mu CDC ne WHO bubadde bwa maanyi.
One major objective was to develop a sustainability plan to continue the work once these organizations pull out.,Ekigendererwa ekimu ekikulu kyali kya kukola enteekateeka ey’okuyimirizaawo okugenda mu maaso n’omulimu ng’ebibiina bino bimaze okufuluma.
"For critical programs like this, specific and deliberate investment is essential [National].","Ku pulogulaamu enkulu nga zino, okuteeka ssente mu nkola eyeetongodde era mu bugenderevu kyetaagisa [eggwanga]."
"To address the potential challenges and threats towards sustainability, major recommendations that were made include the need for domestic investment and commitment for safety surveillance even with the meager financial health resources in the country.","Okukola ku kusoomoozebwa n’okutiisatiisa okuyinza okubaawo eri okuyimirizaawo, ebiteeso ebikulu ebyakolebwa mulimu obwetaavu bw’okusiga ensimbi mu ggwanga n’okwewaayo okulondoola obukuumi ne bwe kiba nga waliwo eby’obugagga by’ensimbi ebitono eby’ensimbi mu ggwanga."
"Such investments would address concerns that while funding was central to safety surveillance, it was largely inadequate.","Ensimbi ng’ezo zandibadde zikwata ku kweraliikirira nti wadde ng’ensimbi ze zisinga okulondoola obukuumi, okusinga tezaali zimala."
So for me Ithink budget allocation for vaccine safety is the biggest driver that will allow how the vaccine and other things are continuing [National].,Kale ku lwange okugabanya embalirira y’okugema kwe kusinga okuvuganya ku ngeri eddagala n’ebintu ebirala gye bigenda mu maaso [eggwanga].
"Participants noted that beyond the physical infrastructure, financial commitment should aim to ensure workers could, if possible, work entirely on vaccine surveillance or provide more than 50% of their time dedicated to the same.","Abeetabye mu kutendekebwa kuno baategeezezza nti okusukka ku bikozesebwa ebirabika, okwewaayo mu by’ensimbi kulina okugenderera okulaba ng’abakozi basobola, bwe kiba kisoboka, okukola ddala ku kulondoola eddagala erigema oba okuwa ebitundu ebisukka mu 50% ku budde bwabwe nga byewaddeyo eri kye kimu."
"At the district level, where we have primary healthcare focused on prevention, there must be an officer aligned with this role.","Ku mutendera gwa disitulikiti, gye tulina obujjanjabi obusookerwako nga essira liteekeddwa ku kuziyiza, wateekwa okubaawo omuserikale akwatagana n’omulimu guno."
Ivote to really support prioritization of vaccine safety and allocate resources for that simply because the technology of vaccines has been very successful.,Ivote okuwagira ddala okukulembeza obukuumi bw’okugema n’okugaba eby’obugagga olw’ekyo olw’okuba tekinologiya w’okugema abadde muwanguzi nnyo.
"Vaccine safety surveillance is crucialso it becomes very important to identify even the small, unwanted effects to put in place mitigation measures, risk communication, and to strengthen the immunization program [National].","Okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema kikulu nnyo kifuuka kikulu nnyo okuzuula n’ebikosa ebitonotono, ebitayagalwa okuteekawo enkola z’okukendeeza ku buzibu, empuliziganya ey’akabi, n’okunyweza enteekateeka y’okugema [eggwanga]."
"There was a delay in the approval of the HBSSS project (submitted , approved 03 ) leading to late implementation.","Waaliwo okulwawo mu kukkiriza pulojekiti ya HBSSS (eyaweebwayo , eyayisibwa 03 ) ekyaviirako okulwawo okussa mu nkola."
"The HBSSS was perceived to have significant benefits, including increased awareness of vaccine safety surveillance even at the community level, enhanced capacity for monitoring vaccine safety, improved signal detection, more efficient reporting, and better patient care.","HBSSS yalowoozebwa okuba n’emigaso mingi, omuli okwongera okumanyisa okulondoola obukuumi bw’eddagala erigema ne ku mutendera gw’ekitundu, obusobozi obw’amaanyi obw’okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema, okulongoosa mu kuzuula obubonero, okukola lipoota mu ngeri ennungi, n’okulabirira obulungi abalwadde."
Expanding surveillance to additional health facilities is essential to maintain preparedness for both existing and emerging vaccine products and technologies.,Okugaziya okulondoola ebifo ebirala eby’obulamu kyetaagisa okukuuma okwetegeka ku bikozesebwa ne tekinologiya eby’okugema ebiriwo n’ebigenda okuvaayo.
Scaling up monitoring beyond adverse events of special interest to include all vaccine-related adverse effects is both relevant and timely.,Okulinnyisa okulondoola okusukka ebizibu eby‟enjawulo okussaamu ebizibu byonna ebikwata ku ddagala erigema kikwatagana era mu budde.
Sustainability of active vaccine safety surveillance was perceived possible only if at least the same project funding is dedicated to the program a long side a better stakeholder mapping with clear roles.,Obuwangaazi bw’okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema obukola bwatwalibwa nga busoboka singa waakiri ensimbi za pulojekiti ze zimu ziweebwayo eri enteekateeka oludda oluwanvu okukola maapu ennungi ey’abakwatibwako n’emirimu egy’olwatu.
"It is very key to plan and allocate the necessary resources, especially finance for diagnostic facilities and human resources to ensure that people whose primary deliverables include vaccine safety surveillance are available.",Kikulu nnyo okuteekateeka n’okugabanya eby’obugagga ebyetaagisa naddala eby’ensimbi eri ebifo ebikebera n’abakozi okulaba ng’abantu abalina ebintu ebikulu ebiweebwa nga mulimu okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema kuliwo.
Integration of active vaccine safety surveillance was recommended including: Decentralization of causality assessment committee Community based vaccine safety surveillance (including lower health facilities since most people first contact these before they go to referral facilities).,Okugatta okulondoola obukuumi bw’eddagala erigema okukola kwateesebwako omuli: okusaasaanya akakiiko akakola ku by’okugema ke kaali kagenda mu maaso mu kitundu okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema abantu mu kitundu (nga mw’otwalidde n’ebifo eby’ebyobulamu ebitono okuva abantu abasinga lwe basooka okutuukirira bino nga tebannagenda mu bifo ebiweebwa abantu).
"Overall, establishing a strategic and resilient national system for active vaccine safety surveillance is crucial for sustaining its benefits.","Okutwaliza awamu, okuteekawo enkola y’eggwanga ey’obukodyo era egumira okulondoola obukuumi bw’okugema okukola kikulu nnyo mu kuyimirizaawo emigaso gyayo."

"Ebola spreads quickly from person to person, kills in a short time BUT can be prevented.","Ebola asaasaana mangu okuva ku muntu okudda ku mulala, atta mu bbanga ttono naye asobola okuziyizibwa."
Is an infected person contagious even if symptoms have A person infected with Ebola is not contagious before the symptoms appear.,ye muntu alina akawuka akasiigibwa ne bwe kiba nti obubonero bw’omuntu alina obulwadde bwa ebola tasiigibwa ng’obubonero tebunnalabika.
The incubation period is 2 to 21 days.,Ekiseera ky’okufumbiza kiba kya nnaku 2 okutuuka ku 21.
What are the signs and symptoms of Ebola?,Obubonero bwa Ebola bwe buliwa?
"High fever (brutal and prolonged) Joint or body pain (especially the chest) Nausea, vomiting (can be bloody) Dehydration (no tears, dry tongue, sunken eyes).","Obulumi bw’omusujja ogw’amaanyi (obuwanvu n’obuwanvu) (naddala ekifuba) okuwunya, okusiiyibwa (kisobola okuggwaamu omusaayi) okuggwaamu amazzi (tewali maziga, olulimi olukalu, amaaso agabbira)."
It is important to note that a person is contagious only when they begin to have one or more signs of the disease.,Kikulu okumanya nti omuntu alina obulwadde bw’obulwadde buno ng’atandika okufuna akabonero kamu oba okusingawo ku bulwadde buno.
"If a person infected by Ebola survives, is she/he No, before returning home, Ebola patients WILL have their blood tested in the laboratory to ensure that the virus is no longer in their body.","Singa omuntu alina obulwadde bwa Ebola awona, abeera she/he nedda, nga tannadda waka, abalwadde ba Ebola bajja kukeberebwa omusaayi mu laboratory okukakasa nti akawuka tekakyali mu mubiri gwabwe."
"However, people who have recovered from the illness should NOT have sex for at least three months unless they use Can Ebola be transmitted by saliva?",Wabula abantu abazze bawona obulwadde tebalina kwegatta okumala waakiri emyezi esatu okuggyako nga bakozesa Ebola amalusu gasobola okusiigibwa amalusu?
"The Ebola Virus can be transmitted by saliva and other bodily skin, the eyes or the mouth of other people, they can get the Can Ebola be transmitted by sweat?","Akawuka ka Ebola kasobola okusiigibwa amalusu n’olususu olulala olw’omubiri, amaaso oba akamwa k’abantu abalala, basobola okufuna ebola y’esobola okusiigibwa entuuyo?"
"Yes, shaking hands with a person infected with Ebola transmits How should Igreet people, if the hand shake is not Hand shaking should be avoided as it is a risk during an Ebola outbreak or before a potential outbreak.","Yee, okukwatagana mu ngalo n’omuntu alina akawuka ka Ebola kiweereza kitya abantu b’omuzira, singa okusika omukono tekuba kukankana mu ngalo kulina okwewalibwa kuba kya bulabe mu kiseera kya Ebola ekibaluseewo oba nga tekinnaba kubutuka."
You can greet people by waving to them or acknowledge by shaking your head.,Osobola okulamusa abantu ng’obawanika oba okukkiriza ng’osika omutwe.
It is very important to wash your hands with soap and clean water What distance do Ineed to keep away from people suspected of having Ebola?,Kikulu nnyo okunaaba emikono gyo ne ssabbuuni n’amazzi amayonjo ggomba ki tereed to daither from people suspected of having ebola?
Avoid touching and handling objects that have been used by a person suspected of having Ebola.,Weewale okukwata n’okukwata ebintu ebibadde bikozesebwa omuntu ateeberezebwa okuba ne Ebola.
Why should Inot eat bush-meat?,Lwaki sirina kulya busawo bwa nsiko?
Wild animals are the source of the Ebola virus.,Ebisolo by’omu nsiko bye bivaamu akawuka ka Ebola.
"If bush-meat is well cooked or smoked, is it safe to eat?","Singa ennyama ya bush-meat efumbiddwa bulungi oba efumbiddwa, kiba kya bulabe okulya?"
"No, because during hunting, slaughtering and preparing bushmeat people are exposed to the Ebola Virus.","Nedda, kubanga mu kiseera ky’okuyigga, okusala n’okuteekateeka abantu b’omu nsiko bakwatibwa akawuka ka Ebola."
That is how transmission occurs and the reason why people should avoid touching or eating bush-meat.,Bw’atyo bw’abaawo n’ensonga lwaki abantu balina okwewala okukwata oba okulya ennyama y’omu nsiko.
"Do Ineed to avoid all bush-meat or just monkey and bat During an Ebola outbreak, avoid all bush-meat because it is very dangerous and can infect you with Ebola.","Nneetaaga okwewala ennyama yonna ey’omu nsiko oba enkima yokka n’omuti mu kiseera ky’okubutuka kwa Ebola, okwewala ennyama yonna ey’omu nsiko kuba kya bulabe nnyo era kisobola okukusiiga Ebola."
"There is no evidence linking Ebola and domestic animals such as chickens, goats and cows.","Tewali bujulizi bukwataganya Ebola n’ebisolo by’awaka ng’enkoko, embuzi n’ente."
"It is only bush-meat that is Can Iget Ebola through contact with urine and droppings Yes, bats are carriers of the Ebola Virus.","Ye bush-meat yokka y’esobola iget ebola okuyita mu kukwatagana n’omusulo n’okusuula Yee, enkima zitwala akawuka ka Ebola."
You can get Ebola if you are in contact with urine and/or droppings of infected bats.,Osobola okufuna Ebola bw’oba okwatagana n’omusulo ne/oba okusuula enkwaso ezirimu obuwuka.
"During the rainy season, there are many bats and they feed on mangoes.","Mu biseera by’enkuba, enkwale nnyingi era zirya emiyembe."
"No, you can continue eating mangoes but wash them before eating.","Nedda, osobola okugenda mu maaso n’okulya emiyembe naye nga ginaabe nga tonnalya."
Do NOT eat mangoes that have been bitten by bats.,Tolya emiyembe egyalumwa enkwale.
Where can Ibuy medicine to treat Ebola?,Ibuy Medicine okujjanjaba Ebola ayinza wa?

"Is it true that a mix of ginger, honey, garlic, onion and No, it is not true.","Kituufu nti okutabula entungo, omubisi gw’enjuki, entungo, obutungulu ne nedda, si kituufu."
There is no home remedy to treat Ebola.,Tewali ddagala lya waka erijjanjaba Ebola.
You must go to the nearest health facility for proper management and treatment if you or someone you suspect has an Ebola infection.,Olina okugenda mu kifo ekikuli okumpi okusobola okuddukanya obulungi n’okujjanjabibwa singa ggwe oba omuntu gw’oteebereza nti alina obulwadde bwa Ebola.
Your chances for survival are far much higher at an Ebola treatment We have heard that drinking alcohol prevents Ebola virus transmission.,Emikisa gyo egy’okuwangaala giri waggulu nnyo ku bujjanjabi bwa Ebola Tuwulidde nti okunywa omwenge kiziyiza akawuka ka Ebola okusiiga.
"No, it is not true.","Nedda, si kituufu."
"In fact, excessive consumption of alcohol is harmful to your body.","Mu butuufu, okunywa ennyo omwenge kya bulabe eri omubiri gwo."
Is it true that Ebola is a curse?,Kituufu nti Ebola kikolimo?
"No, it is not true.","Nedda, si kituufu."
Ebola is a viral disease transmitted to humans from infected wild animals.,Ebola bulwadde bwa kawuka obusiigibwa abantu okuva mu bisolo by’omu nsiko ebirina obulwadde buno.
It can also be spread from an infected person to another person.,Era kiyinza okusaasaanyizibwa okuva ku muntu alina akawuka n’adda ku muntu omulala.
"No, you are endangering the lives of your loved ones, your own life and those of the community, because the disease can easily spread from one person to another.","Nedda, oba oteeka obulamu bw’abaagalwa bo mu matigga, obulamu bwo n’obw’omu kitundu, kubanga obulwadde buno busobola bulungi okusaasaana okuva ku muntu omu okudda ku mulala."
What system has the Government put in place to screen Ebola and are able to identify any suspicious cases on arrival and What plans does the Government have to send information about Ebola to the rural population?,Enkola ki gavumenti gy’etaddewo okukebera Ebola era esobola okuzuula emisango gyonna egy’okuteebereza nga gituuse era gavumenti erina okuweereza amawulire agakwata ku Ebola eri abantu b’omu byalo?
Communication materials such as posters and fact sheets have also been developed and Radio and SMS is also being used to reach rural communities.,Ebikozesebwa mu mpuliziganya nga ebipande n’ebiwandiiko ebituufu nabyo bikoleddwa era leediyo era n’okuweereza obubaka ku ssimu (SMS) era nga kukozesebwa okutuuka mu bitundu by’ebyalo.
"Currently, there is no plan for closing the borders or pose called upon to remain vigilant by practicing the set prevention behaviours and also to report to the nearest health facility any persons they suspect to have signs and symptoms of Ebola.","Mu kiseera kino, tewali nteekateeka ya kuggala nsalo oba pose okuyitibwa okusigala nga oli bulindaala nga bakola enneeyisa z’okuziyiza eziteekeddwawo era n’okukola lipoota mu kifo eky’ebyobulamu ekiriraanyewo abantu bonna be bateebereza okuba n’obubonero n’obubonero bwa Ebola."

"Yet are these women getting the support they need to be successful, or are they being impeded?","Naye abakyala bano bafuna obuwagizi bwe beetaaga okusobola okutuuka ku buwanguzi, oba balemesebwa?"
These questions provide a possible theme for a further report.,Ebibuuzo bino biwa omulamwa oguyinza okubaawo ku lipoota endala.
"We also see the most diverse cohort of new leaders to date, a testament to the hard work within organisations to publish In this Report, Global Health 50/50 has undertaken an eye opening and critical examination of the governance landscape of global organisations active in health, which deeply resonates with me on a personal level and is both enlightening and sobering.","Era tulaba ekibinja ekisinga okuba eky’enjawulo eky’abakulembeze abapya okutuusa kati, obujulizi ku mulimu omunene mu bibiina okufulumya mu lipoota eno, Global Health 50/50 ekoze okuggulawo amaaso n’okwekenneenya enfuga y’enfuga y’ebibiina by’ensi yonna ebikola mu by’obulamu, ekikwata ennyo nange ku mutendera gw’omuntu era nga kitangaaza era nga kitegeera bulungi."
"Shockingly, only 2% of nonprofit board seats are held by women from low-income countries, while 17% are held by men from the USA.","Ekyewuunyisa, ebitundu 2% byokka ku bifo ebitali bya magoba ku lukiiko olufuzi bye bikuumibwa abakyala okuva mu mawanga agafuna ssente entono, ate 17% basajja okuva mu USA."
The need to improve womens representation in boardrooms and across leadership teams cannot be overstated.,Obwetaavu bw’okutumbula okukiikirira abakyala mu boardrooms ne mu ttiimu z’obukulembeze zonna teziyinza kuyitirira.
"Its not just about equality, it is also strategic.","Its not just about equality, nayo ya bukodyo."
"Diverse boards are better equipped to understand and respond to the needs of their stakeholders and the populations they aspire to serve, leading to improved corporate governance and As the first black woman to Chair the FIND Board of Directors Iam undoubtedly better equipped to serve the needs of populations in the Global South than my overrepresented counterparts from highincome countries.","Obukiiko obw’enjawulo buba n’ebikozesebwa ebisinga okutegeera n’okuddamu ebyetaago by’abakwatibwako n’abantu be baagala okuweereza, ekivaako okulongoosa enfuga y’ebitongole era ng’omukyala omuddugavu eyasooka okukubiriza olukiiko olufuzi olwa Find Iam Iam awatali kubuusabuusa ebikozesebwa ebirungi okuweereza ebyetaago by’abantu mu nsi yonna mu nsi yonna okusinga bannange abasukkiridde okukiikirira okuva mu mawanga agatali manene."
Icant help but wonder if their response would have been different had those same decisions been made by a white man from a high-income country.,Siyinza butabuuza oba okuddamu kwabwe kwandibadde kwa njawulo singa ebyo bye bimu byasalibwawo omuzungu okuva mu nsi erimu ssente ennyingi.
"It may be that for more women to step into leadership positions, the models and methodologies of leadership itself need to be reconsidered.","Kiyinza okuba nti abakyala bangi okulinnya mu bifo by’obukulembeze, ebikozesebwa n’enkola z’obukulembeze bwennyini byetaaga okuddamu okulowoozebwako."
"So, Ido not want a seat at the Definitions of leadership can no longer be centred on traditionally masculine traits but must encompass compassion, empathy and the humanity of those whose lives are at stake.","Kale, ido not want a seat at the definitions of leadership teyinza kuddamu kubeera nga yeesigamiziddwa ku mpisa z’ekisajja mu buwangwa wabula erina okuzingiramu okusaasira, okusaasira n’obuntubulamu bw’abo obulamu bwabwe bwe bali mu kabi."
"In her book, Feminism is for Everybody, bell hooks wrote, We should never leave it to women and equity-seeking leaders to carry the weight of gender-sensitive, equity-mindful, and diversity-unlocking decision-making alone.","Mu kitabo kye, feminism eri eri buli muntu, Bell Hooks yawandiika, tetusaanidde kukireka eri abakyala n’abakulembeze abanoonya obwenkanya okutwala obuzito bw’okusalawo okukwata ku kikula ky’abantu, obwenkanya, n’okusumulula enjawulo yokka."

"In the past two years since we first investigated board representation, we find that boards have more women and more nationals from Gender equality is not just a lofty ideal; it is a fundamental human right and an essential precondition for achieving all the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the crucial areas of health and well-being.","Mu myaka ebiri egiyise bukya tusooka kunoonyereza ku kukiikirira olukiiko, tusanga nti boards zirina abakyala bangi era bannansi bangi okuva mu kikula ky’abantu si ndowooza ya waggulu yokka; Eddembe ly’obuntu ery’omusingi era kakwakkulizo akakulu ak’okusooka okutuukiriza ebiruubirirwa byonna ebiragiddwa mu nteekateeka ya 2030 ey’enkulaakulana ey’olubeerera, omuli ebitundu ebikulu eby’ebyobulamu n’obulamu obulungi."
"For the first time, gender parity has been reached among board chairs in the nonprofits, and the newest cohort of leaders is more diverse than ever before.","Omulundi ogusoose, ekikula ky’abantu kituuse mu ba Ssentebe b’olukiiko olufuzi mu bitongole ebitali bya magoba, era ekibinja ky’abakulembeze ekipya kya njawulo okusinga bwe kyali kibadde."
This is a clear indicator that change is not only possible but is already happening.,Kino kiraga bulungi nti enkyukakyuka tesobola kukoma ku kusobola wabula yabaawo dda.
And we commend those organisations that have upped their game.,Era tusiima ebibiina ebyo ebitumbudde omuzannyo gwabyo.
"However, American men still hold more global health board seats than women from all 57 low- and middle-income Additionally, the Report underscores that in decision-making spaces with greater female representation, women are more likely to ascend to leadership roles.","Wabula abasajja b’omu Amerika bakyalina ebifo bingi eby’olukiiko lw’ebyobulamu mu nsi yonna okusinga abakyala okuva mu byonna 57 eby’ensimbi entono n’eza wakati nga kwogasse, alipoota eno eraga nti mu bifo eby’okusalawo ebirina okukiikirira abakyala okusingawo, abakyala batera okulinnya ku mirimu gy’obukulembeze."
"Overtime we have documented the positive impact of these efforts, evidenced by policy changes and progress However, this progress is fragile and possibly at threat and future gains are far from assured.","Overtime Tuwandiise ebirungi ebiva mu kaweefube ono, nga kino kikakasibwa enkyukakyuka mu nkola n’okukulaakulana wabula, enkulaakulana eno eba nnywevu era nga kiyinzika okuba nga eri mu kutiisibwatiisibwa era mu biseera eby’omu maaso efuna okukakasibwa."
"We are witnessing a wellfunded, organised backlash aiming to undermine the progress made in gender equality, womens rights, bodily autonomy, and gender diversity.","Tulaba okudda emabega okufunza obulungi, okutegekeddwa nga tugenderera okutyoboola enkulaakulana ekoleddwa mu ky’okwenkanankana kw’ekikula ky’abantu, eddembe ly’abakyala, okwefuga kw’omubiri, n’enjawulo mu kikula ky’abantu."
"It is vital that we consider any positive changes in policy and leadership in recent years, highlighted in this Report, with a long-term perspective and strive to ensure we do not see a step backwards Encouragingly, we are seeing a small but positive movement in terms of investment.","Kikulu nnyo okulowooza ku nkyukakyuka zonna ennungi mu nkola n’obukulembeze mu myaka egiyise, okulagibwa mu alipoota eno, nga tulina endowooza ey’ekiseera ekiwanvu era tufuba okulaba nga tetulaba ddaala emabega nga kizzaamu amaanyi, tulaba entambula entono naye ennungi mu nsonga z’okusiga ensimbi."
"An Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) analysis revealed that during , 62% of official development assistance was gender blind and only 4% was allocated to programmes in which gender equality and womens empowerment was the main objective.","Okwekenenya ekitongole ekivunaanyizibwa ku nkolagana n’enkulaakulana mu by’enfuna (OECD) kwalaga nti mu kiseera , 62% ku buyambi obutongole obw’enkulaakulana bwali bwa kikula kya kikula ky’abantu era 4% bokka be baaweebwa enteekateeka nga obwenkanya mu kikula ky’abantu n’okutumbula abakyala kye kyali ekigendererwa ekikulu."
"Feminist funding initiatives have sought to fill this gap, with a welcome focus on resourcing progressive women-led movements fighting for gender justice, especially in While we would like to see even greater investments, including from governments, equally importantly, accountability mechanisms must be prioritised alongside advocacy to ensure real, lasting change.","Enteekateeka z’okusonda ssente z’abakyala zifubye okuziba ekituli kino, nga essira liteekeddwa ku kuwa ebibiina ebikulemberwa enkulaakulana y’abakyala ebisobola okukozesa obwenkanya, naddala mu sso nga twandiyagadde okulaba ssente ezisingawo n’okusingawo, omuli n’okuva mu gavumenti, kyenkanyi, enkola z’obuvunaanyizibwa zirina okukulembeza wamu n’okubunyisa amawulire okulaba ng’enkyukakyuka entuufu, ey’olubeerera."
We have seen the power or at least the potential of accountability in initiatives such as The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in opposing the effects of discrimination around the world.,Tulabye obuyinza oba waakiri obusobozi bw’obuvunaanyizibwa mu nteekateeka ng’endagaano y’okumalawo okusosola abakyala (CEDAW) mu ngeri zonna mu kuwakanya ebiva mu kusosola okwetoloola ensi yonna.
"We hope that the data in our report will provide young women, staff associations and other reformers with some of the evidence that will help them hold their organisations to account for greater diversity and equity in Achieving gender equality is not a secondary goal but a cornerstone of a sustainable and just future.","Tusuubira nti data mu lipoota yaffe ejja kuwa abakyala abato, ebibiina by’abakozi n’abalala abatereeza obujulizi obumu obujja okubayamba okukwatira ddala ebibiina byabwe okubala enjawulo ennene n’obwenkanya mu kutuuka ku ky’okwenkanankana mu kikula ky’abantu si kiruubirirwa kya kubiri wabula jjinja ery’oku nsonda mu biseera eby’omu maaso ebiwangaala era byokka."
Most organisations in the sample are headquartered in high-income countries.,Ebibiina ebisinga obungi mu sampuli eno bibeera mu nsi ezirina ssente ennyingi.
"This geographical locus of power heavily influences the composition of their In nonprofit organisations, most board seats are occupied by nationals from high-income countries, with only 5% held by nationals from low-income countries.","Ekifo kino eky’obuyinza kikwata nnyo ku butonde bw’ebibiina byabwe ebitali bya magoba, ebifo ebisinga eby’olukiiko olufuzi bibeera bannansi okuva mu mawanga agafuna ssente ennyingi, nga 5% bokka bannansi bannansi okuva mu mawanga agafuna ssente entono."
"Women from low-income countries hold just 2% of nonprofit board seats, while 17% of seats are held by men from the USA alone.","Abakyala okuva mu mawanga agafuna ssente entono balina ebitundu 2% byokka ku bifo ebitali bya magoba ku lukiiko olufuzi, ate ebitundu 17% ku bifo basajja okuva mu USA yokka."
The proportion of women and nationals from low- and middle-income countries is even lower on the boards of for-profit companies in the sample.,Ekitundu ky’abakyala n’abantu b’eggwanga okuva mu mawanga agafuna ssente entono n’egya wakati kikendedde nnyo ku lukiiko olufuzi olwa kkampuni ezikola amagoba mu sampuli.
The newest cohort of board chairs is more diverse than GH5050 first reported.,Ekibinja ekipya eky’entebe z’oku bboodi kya njawulo okusinga GH5050 kye yasooka okutegeeza.
"For the first time, gender parity among board chairs in nonprofit organisations has been achieved, with 51% of board chairs being women, a significant change from 30% in 2018.","Omulundi ogusoose, ekikula ky’abantu mu bibiina by’olukiiko olufuzi mu bibiina ebitali bya magoba kituukiddwaako, nga 51% ku ntebe z’olukiiko zibeera bakyala, enkyukakyuka ey’amaanyi okuva ku bitundu 30% mu 2018."
"This progress mirrors the rise in public commitments to gender equality, which have grown from 68% in 2018 to 91% in 2024 among nonprofits in our sample.","Enkulaakulana eno eraga okweyongera kw’obweyamo bw’olukale eri obwenkanya mu kikula ky’abantu, ebikuze okuva ku bitundu 68% mu 2018 okutuuka ku bitundu 91% mu 2024 mu bitongole ebitali bya magoba mu sampuli yaffe."
"Drawing on seven years of annual assessments, the Report finds that while some progress has been made, significant and alarming gaps remain, especially in diversity in leadership and pay equity.","Nga tusinziira ku myaka musanvu egy’okukeberebwa buli mwaka, lipoota ezudde nti wadde ng’enkulaakulana ezimu zikoleddwa, ebituli eby’amaanyi era ebyewuunyisa bisigaddewo naddala mu njawulo mu bukulembeze n’obwenkanya mu kusasula."
This increase should be celebrated.,Okweyongera kuno kulina okukuzibwa.
"However, gender parity has not been achieved in all sectors.","Wabula, ekikula ky’abantu tekituukiddwaako mu bitundu byonna."
"Among for-profit companies, only 16% of board chairs are women.","Mu kkampuni ezikola amagoba, ebitundu 16% byokka ku ntebe z’olukiiko be bakyala."
"While low, this is a marked increase from 2% since 2018.","Wadde nga ntono, kino kyeyongera nnyo okuva ku bitundu 2% okuva mu 2018."
A closer look at power and pay reveals inequities even when gender parity has been achieved.,Okutunuulira ennyo obuyinza n’omusaala kiraga obutali bwenkanya ne bwe kiba nti ekikula ky’abantu kituukiddwaako.
"An assessment of the nonprofits in the GH5050 sample that submit US tax returns shows that while more than half of CEOs are women, men lead organisations with average revenues more than twice as large as those led by women.","Okukebera ebibiina ebitali bya magoba mu sampuli ya GH5050 ebiwaayo ebiwandiiko by’omusolo mu Amerika biraga nti wadde nga kitundu kya ba CEO basinga bakyala, abasajja bakulembera ebibiina ebirina ssente eza wakati okusinga emirundi ebiri okusinga ezo ezikulemberwa abakyala."
"As larger revenues are linked to larger salaries for CEOs, men CEOs earn on average $ more annually than their women counterparts.","Nga ssente ennyingi bwe zikwatagana n’emisaala eminene eri ba CEO, basajja CEO bafuna ku average $ okusinga buli mwaka bannaabwe abakyala."
"Gender pay inequalities are rampant driven by, for example, womens historically lower pay, the disproportionately low representation of women in senior roles, occupational segregation, and gender discrimination.","Obutenkanankana mu kusasula ekikula ky’abantu buyitiridde, okugeza, abakyala mu byafaayo okusasulwa ssente entono, okukiikirira abakyala mu ngeri etategeerekeka mu mirimu egy’oku ntikko, okwawula mu mirimu, n’okusosola mu kikula ky’abantu."
"In the UK, where gender pay gap reporting is mandatory, there has been some progress towards equality.","Mu Bungereza, ng’ekituli mu nsasula y’ekikula ky’abantu kikakatako, wabaddewo enkulaakulana eri mu ky’okwenkanankana."
"The median gender pay gap, which measures pay gaps across an entire workforce, has decreased from 13.1% to 10.9% since 2017 among organisations in our sample.","Ekituli mu nsasula y’ekikula ky’abantu ekya wakati, ekipima ebituli mu nsasula mu bakozi bonna, kikendedde okuva ku bitundu 13.1% okutuuka ku bitundu 10.9% okuva mu 2017 mu bibiina mu sampuli yaffe."
"The underrepresentation of individuals from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially women, in decision-making roles is a stark reminder of the work still needed to achieve global health equity.","Obutakiikirira abantu ssekinnoomu okuva mu nsi ezirina ensimbi entono n’eza wakati (LMICs), naddala abakyala, mu mirimu gy’okusalawo kijjukiza nnyo omulimu ogukyalina okwetaagisa okutuukiriza obwenkanya mu by’obulamu mu nsi yonna."
"Only through sustained and collective effort can we hope to dismantle the entrenched power structures that perpetuate inequities in global health Evagora-Campbell M, Kedia S, Odero HO, et al.","Okuyita mu kaweefube ow’olubeerera era ow’okwegatta yekka y’asobola okusuubira okumenyawo ensengekera z’amaanyi ezisimbye amakanda ezinyweza obutali bwenkanya mu by’obulamu bw’ensi yonna Evagora-Campbell M, Kedia S, Odero Ho, et al."

The average salary for men was average salary for women ($).,Omusaala ogwa wakati ogw’abasajja gwali gwa musaala gwa wakati eri abakyala ($).
"This represents a gap of 28% - an increase from 2015, when the salary gap between men and women was 18% ($ for men The average total revenue of organisations led by men was more than twice that of organisations led by women in 2021 ($389 million compared to $187 million).","Kino kitegeeza ekituli kya 28% - okweyongera okuva mu 2015, ekituli ky’emisaala wakati w’abasajja n’abakazi kyali 18% ($ eri abasajja omuwendo gwonna ogw’ebibiina ebikulemberwa abasajja gwali gusukka emirundi ebiri ogw’ebibiina ebyakulemberwa abakyala mu 2021 (obukadde bwa ddoola 389 bw’ogeraageranya n’obukadde bwa ddoola 187)."
"The average difference in revenue of organisations led by women compared men fell from a ratio of 3:1 in 2015 to 2:1 While this remains a small sample and should be interpreted with caution, our findings are consistent with another finding in this Report that smaller organisations are more likely to have women board chairs than larger organisations (see pg 23).","Enjawulo ya wakati mu nfuna y’ebibiina ebikulemberwa abakyala abageraageranye yagwa okuva ku mugerageranyo gwa 3:1 mu 2015 okutuuka ku 2:1 ate kino kisigala nga kya sampuli kitono era kisaana okutaputibwa n’obwegendereza, bye tuzudde bikwatagana n’ekizuuliddwa ekirala mu lipoota eno nti ebibiina ebitono bitera okuba n’entebe z’olukiiko olufuzi okusinga ebibiina ebinene (laba olupapula 23)."

"Data from the UK, where gender pay gap reporting is mandatory (see next section), shows that the difference in pay increases among older populations and is largest among the highest earners.3 Women generally begin their careers closer to pay parity with men, but they lose ground as they age and progress through their work lives, due to a range of factors including parenthood and occupational segregation.3 Clerkin, C., Diomande, M., Koob, A. .","Data from the UK, awali ekituli mu nsasula y’ekikula ky’abantu nga kikakatako (laba ekitundu ekiddako), kiraga nti enjawulo mu kweyongera kw’omusaala mu bantu abakadde era esinga obunene mu basinga okufuna ssente.3 Okutwalira awamu abakyala batandika emirimu gyabwe okumpi n’okusasula abasajja, naye bafiirwa ettaka nga bakaddiwa n’okukulaakulana okuyita mu bulamu bwabwe obw’emirimu, olw’ensonga ezitali zimu omuli abazadde, A.3, C.3 Clerkin, C., C., C., C., C., C., C., C., C., C., C., C.3 Clerkin, C., C.3 Clerkin, C.3, C.3, C.3 Clerkin, C.3 Clerkin, C.3, C.3 CLERKIN."

"As we have previously reported, in the absence of mandatory reporting, exceedingly few organisations voluntarily publish their In the UK, discrimination and disparities faced by ethnic minority employees are well-documented and evidence has shown that the gender pay gap widens for certain ethnic groups.6 Despite calls for reporting of the ethnicity pay gap to be made mandatory, however, the UK Government has stated that it will remain voluntary for Even in the absence of legislative requirements, employers active in global health, who are often working to advance social justice and gender equality, should act as models for career equality, including by publicly reporting pay gap data.","Nga bwe twategeeza emabegako, mu butabeerawo lipoota ya kiragiro, ebibiina bitono ebisukkiridde okufulumya kyeyagalire mu Bungereza, okusosolwa n’obutafaanagana obutuusibwako amawanga amatono abakozi bawandiikiddwa bulungi era obujulizi bulaze nti ekituli mu nsasula y’ekikula ky’abantu kigaziwa eri amawanga agamu.

"The conceptualisation of gender as interacting with but different from sex and as a relational, contextual, and changing social construction that influences who holds power is foundational to understanding how gender influences both career pathways and health outcomes.","Endowooza y‟ekikula ky‟abantu nga ekwatagana naye nga ya njawulo ku kwegatta era ng‟enzimba y‟enkolagana, embeera, n‟enkyukakyuka mu mbeera z‟abantu ekwata ku ani alina obuyinza kikulu nnyo okutegeera engeri ekikula ky‟abantu gye kikwata ku makubo gombi ag‟emirimu n‟ebiva mu bulamu."

"As a social construct, gender varies from society to society and can change over time.","Nga enzimba y’embeera z’abantu, ekikula ky’abantu kyawukana okusinziira ku bantu era kisobola okukyuka okumala ekiseera."
"Gender is the social roles, behaviours, activities, attributes, and opportunities that any society considers appropriate for girls and boys; women and men; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex life populations.","Ekikula ky‟abantu gwe mirimu gy‟embeera z‟abantu, enneeyisa, emirimu, engeri, n‟emikisa ekibiina kyonna kye kitwala ng‟ekituufu eri abawala n‟abalenzi; abakyala n’abasajja; ne lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, ne intersex life populations."

Gender is about the roles of people of all diversities.,Ekikula ky’abantu kikwata ku mirimu gy’abantu ab’enjawulo bonna.
It is not only about women.,Si kya bakyala bokka.
The roles that women have are fundamentally shaped by the roles that men have.,Emirimu abakyala gye balina gikolebwa mu musingi olw’emirimu abasajja gye balina.

"Gender analysis has increasingly revealed how womens subordination is socially constructed, and therefore able to change, as opposed to being biologically predetermined and Clarity around the concept of gender should be considered as foundational to gender analysis and gender assessments of career structures, health policies and programmes.","Okwekenenya ekikula ky’abantu kweyongedde okulaga engeri abakyala gye bazimbibwamu wansi w’embeera z’abantu, n’olwekyo okusobola okukyuka, okuwukana ku kuteekebwawo mu bitonde n’okutegeera obulungi okwetoloola endowooza y’ekikula ky’abantu kulina okutwalibwa ng’omusingi mu kwekenneenya ekikula ky’abantu n’okukebera ekikula ky’abantu mu nsengeka z’emirimu, enkola z’ebyobulamu ne pulogulaamu."
"Given that advancing health and social justice is not the purpose of most of the for-profit companies in our sample, we would not necessarily expect them to provide public definitions of gender  and find that they largely do not.","Okusinziira ku kuba nti okutumbula obwenkanya mu by’obulamu n’embeera z’abantu si kye kigendererwa kya kkampuni ezisinga obungi ezikola amagoba mu sampuli yaffe, tetwandisuubidde nti ejja kuwa ennyonyola z’abantu ku kikula ky’abantu era n’okukizuula nti okusinga tezikola."

Organisations in HICs tend to have a majority of board members from HICs and organisations in LMICs have a majority of board members from LMICs.,Ebibiina mu HICS bitera okuba n’ababaka abasinga obungi ku lukiiko olufuzi okuva mu HICs n’ebibiina mu LMICs birina abasinga obungi ku bammemba b’olukiiko olufuzi okuva mu LMICs.
At the same time HIC organisations have a higher proportion of female board membership.,Mu kiseera kye kimu ebibiina bya HIC birina ekitundu ekinene eky’obukiise bw’abakyala ku lukiiko.
"Furthermore, while the shares of CEOs and board chairs that are men and nationals from HICs have decreased since 2020, almost 9 out of 10 CEOS and board chairs were educated in high-income countries in 2024.","Ekirala, wadde emigabo gya CEO ne olukiiko olufuzi nga basajja n’abantu b’eggwanga okuva mu HICs zikendedde okuva mu 2020, kumpi 9 ku ba CEO 10 n’entebe z’olukiiko zasomesebwa mu mawanga agalina ssente ennyingi mu 2024."
"This raises important questions about what is valued in leadership and which global perspectives dominate, while also pointing to the need to strengthen tertiary education in LMICs.","Kino kireeta ebibuuzo ebikulu ku biki ebibalirirwa mu bukulembeze era endowooza z’ensi yonna zisinga, ate nga era zisonga ku bwetaavu bw’okunyweza ebyenjigiriza eby’amatendekero aga waggulu mu LMICs."
"Ultimately, this data reminds us that where agendas, knowledge and capital are produced dictates power and privilege.","Mu nkomerero, data eno etujjukiza nti agenda, okumanya ne kapito we bikolebwa okulagira obuyinza n’enkizo."
"While the Report has highlighted some positive trends, now is not the time for complacency.","Wadde nga alipoota eno eraga nti waliwo ebirungi ebigenda mu maaso, kati si kye kiseera eky’okwemalira."
"These statements alone are not sufficient, and at the same time definitions of excellence are not bias free and access to elite institutions is not equal.","Ebigambo bino byokka tebimala, era mu kiseera kye kimu ennyonyola z’obulungi tezirina kyekubiira era okutuuka ku bitongole eby’ekika ekya waggulu si kyenkanyi."
There is growing intolerance and constant pushback on the struggle for social justice.,Waliwo obutagumiragana n’okudda emabega buli kiseera ku lutalo lw’obwenkanya mu bantu.
"Womens rights, LGBTQI, disability and indigenous groups have enriched the gender justice movement and driven progress, including for bodily autonomy.","Eddembe ly’abakyala, LGBTQI, obulemu n’ebibiina by’abantu enzaalwa bigaggawalidde ekibiina ky’obwenkanya mu kikula ky’abantu n’okuvugisa enkulaakulana, omuli n’okwefuga kw’omubiri."
"However, our differences have become divisive, fragmenting our social justice agenda.","Kyokka, enjawulo zaffe zifuuse za njawukana, nga zikutulamu enteekateeka yaffe ey’obwenkanya mu mbeera z’abantu."
"These divisions are further sown by anti-gender justice actors who endeavor to maintain systems of patriarchy, racism, colonialism, and religious fundamentalism, colluding with State and other actors to maintain power in the few hands who have long How can we withstand this rising tide of regressive and anti-gender justice forces?","Enjawukana zino zongera okusigibwa abazannyi b’obwenkanya abalwanyisa ekikula abafuba okukuuma enkola z’obufuzi bw’abasajja, obusosoze mu mawanga, obufuzi bw’amatwale, n’obufuzi bw’eddiini obw’omusingi, nga twekobaana n’amawanga n’abazannyi abalala okukuuma obuyinza mu mikono emitono egy’ekiseera ekiwanvu tuyinza tutya okugumira amazzi gano agagenda geeyongera amaanyi ag’obwenkanya agadda emabega n’okulwanyisa ekikula?"
"Ibelieve that now more than ever, feminist leadership is needed.","Ibelieve nti kati okusinga bwe kyali kibadde, obukulembeze bw’abakyala bwetaagibwa."
"Feminist leadership is about sharing power to build inclusive, just and caring organisations and systems.","Obukulembeze bw’abakyala bukwata ku kugabana obuyinza okuzimba ebibiina n’enkola ezirimu abantu bonna, ez’obwenkanya era ezifaayo."
"We need to have honest conversations within the movement, link across different sectors, and reframe the narrative around what is possible when we work in solidarity rather than in opposition.","Tulina okuba n’emboozi ez’amazima munda mu kibiina, okuyunga mu bitundu eby’enjawulo, n’okuddamu okuteekawo ennyiriri okwetoloola ekisoboka nga tukola mu kwegatta okusinga mu kuwakanya."

There is too much at stake to stop now.,Waliwo bingi ebisusse okuyimirira kati.
"Note: This brief opinion piece is shaped by the privilege of engaging with feminist activists from around the world, each working to make our socio-economic systems more just and caring.","Weetegereze: Kino ekitundu ekimpi eky’endowooza kikolebwa enkizo y’okukwatagana n’abalwanirizi b’eddembe ly’abakyala okuva mu nsi yonna, buli kimu nga kikola okufuula enkola zaffe ez’eby’enfuna n’embeera z’abantu mu bwenkanya n’okufaayo."

"GH5050 explored how many organisations have board diversity policies in the public domain, and which of those have specific measures, such as targets, to make and monitor progress.","GH5050 yanoonyereza ku bungi bw’ebibiina ebirina enkola z’enjawulo ez’olukiiko mu lujjudde, era ku ebyo ani alina ebipimo ebitongole, gamba ng’ebiruubirirwa, okukola n’okulondoola enkulaakulana."

"With growing public recognition of the importance of gender equality in governance spaces, as a matter of fairness and as a contribution to improved decision-making, corporate performance and financial outcomes, demands on governments to take action to ensure women are fairly represented on boards Several countries have implemented regulations and initiatives to increase gender diversity on corporate boards.","Nga abantu beeyongera okukkiriza obukulu bw’okwenkanankana kw’ekikula ky’abantu mu bifo eby’enfuga, ng’ensonga y’obwenkanya era ng’omugabo mu kulongoosa okusalawo, enkola y’ebitongole n’ebiva mu by’ensimbi, okusaba kwa gavumenti okukola okulaba ng’abakyala bakiikirirwa mu bwenkanya ku lukiiko amawanga agawerako gassa mu nkola amateeka n’enteekateeka ez’okwongera ku njawulo mu kikula ky’abantu ku bufuzi bw’ebitongole."

"Among the sample of 201 organisations which GH5050 annually assesses, this board review excluded organisations whose board compositions are determined by national governments (e.g., bilateral agencies) and/or member states (e.g., UN agencies).","Mu sampuli y’ebibiina 201 GH5050 by’ekebera buli mwaka, okwekenneenya kuno okw’olukiiko kwaggyako ebibiina ebirina ebitonde by’olukiiko ebisalibwawo gavumenti z’amawanga (e.g., ebitongole by’amawanga gombi) ne/oba amawanga agali mu mukago (e.g., ebitongole by’ekibiina ky’Amawanga Amagatte)."
"Data collected on each board member includes the gender and nationality of board members, their place of employment, and where the organisation they work for is headquartered.","Ebikwata ku buli mmemba w’olukiiko olufuzi birimu ekikula ky’abantu n’eggwanga lya bammemba b’olukiiko, ekifo we bakolera, n’ekibiina kye bakolera we kiri."
Data was drawn primarily from individuals online biosketches and Linked.,Data yaggyibwa okusinga okuva mu bantu ssekinnoomu ku yintaneeti biosketches era nga ziyungiddwa.
Discrepancies were discussed with a third reviewer until consensus was reached on the final entry.,Enjawukana zateesebwako n’omuntu owookusatu okutuusa lwe yatuuka ku nzikiriziganya ku kuyingira okusembayo.
Board membership demographic data is not validated with organisations.,Ebikwata ku bammemba b’olukiiko olufuzi (Board Membership Demographic Data) tebikakasibwa n’ebibiina.
"In that correspondence, we request the nomination and contact details of a focal point in the organisation who can review and validate the data once collected.","Mu kuwandiikira okwo, tusaba okusunsulwa n’ebikwata ku nsonga y’ekifo ekikulu mu kitongole asobola okwetegereza n’okukakasa ebikwata ku bantu nga bimaze okukung’aanyizibwa."
"Following completion of data collection, we send each organisation their preliminary results and ask them to review and provide any additional information, documentation or policies to review.","Oluvannyuma lw’okumaliriza okukung’aanya ebikwata ku bantu, buli kitongole tukiweereza ebivuddemu ebisookerwako era ne tubasaba okwekenneenya n’okuwaayo amawulire gonna ag’enjawulo, ebiwandiiko oba enkola z’olina okwetegereza."
Results are shared with all organisations before publication.,Ebivuddemu bigabana n’ebibiina byonna nga tebinnaba kufulumizibwa.
The status of an organisation as nonprofit or for-profit and whether an organisation is headquartered in an LMIC were binary variables.,Embeera y’ekitongole ng’ekitali kya magoba oba eky’amagoba n’okumanya oba ekitebe ky’ekitongole kiri mu LMIC byali bikyukakyuka bya binary.
"Percentages of women on senior management teams, women on governing boards, and LMIC nationalities on governing boards were continuous variables.","Ebitundu by’abakyala ku ttiimu z’abakulira abakulu, abakyala ku lukiiko olufuzi, n’amawanga ga LMIC ku bukiiko obufuga byali bikyukakyuka ebigenda mu maaso."
"Organization size was recoded as follows: 1 to 49 employees as 1, Following that, we conducted regression analyses to examine relationships between variables.","Enkula y’ekitongole yaddamu okulongoosebwa bweti: 1 okutuuka ku 49 abakozi nga 1, oluvannyuma lw’ekyo, twakola okwekenneenya okw’okudda emabega okwekenneenya enkolagana wakati w’enkyukakyuka."
"Linear regression was used where the outcome was continuous (e.g., percentage of women on boards), and logistic regression was used where the outcome was binary (e.g., gender equality workplace policy with specific measures).","Linear regression was used where the outcome was continuous (e.g., percentage of women on boards), era logistic regression yakozesebwa nga ekivaamu kyali binary (e.g., enkola y’emirimu gy’okwenkanankana mu kikula ky’abantu n’ebipimo ebitongole)."
Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were conducted.,Okwekenenya kwombi okutatereezeddwa n’okutereezebwa kwakolebwa.
"For instance, to examine whether being nonprofit was correlated with a higher percentage of women on governing boards, we controlled for the percentage of women on senior management teams, gender of CEO and board chair, percentage of LMIC nationalities on governing boards and organisation size.","Okugeza, okwekenneenya oba okubeera nga si magoba kyali kikwatagana n’ebitundu ebisinga obungi eby’abakyala ku bukiiko obufuga, twafuga ku bitundu by’abakyala ku ttiimu z’abakulira abakulu, ekikula ky’omukulu w’ekitongole n’olukiiko, ebitundu by’amawanga ga LMIC ku bukiiko obufuga n’obunene bw’ekitongole."
"The strengths of correlations were noted, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant.","Amaanyi g’enkolagana gaali gategeerekese, nga p<0.05 etunuuliddwa mu by’emitindo."
"Statistically significant results are indicated in the report, with correlation strengths for US-based organisations US-based nonprofits are required to report their tax records to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) every year.","Ebivuddemu ebikulu mu bibalo biragiddwa mu lipoota, n’amaanyi g’enkolagana eri ebibiina ebisangibwa mu Amerika ebitongole ebitali bya magoba eby’omu Amerika byetaagibwa okutegeeza ebiwandiiko byabwe eby’omusolo eri ekitongole kya Amerika ekivunaanyizibwa ku musolo (IRS) buli mwaka."
"Where data was unavailable on IRS (due to delays in processing tax records), we used data from Pro.","Awali data eyali tesobola ku IRS (olw’okulwawo okukola ku biwandiiko by’omusolo), twakozesa data okuva mu Pro."
"Then, we analysed differences in CEO pay by gender and the revenue size of organisations led Organisations with 250 employees in the UK are legally required to report their gender pay gap data to the UK government every year, while smaller organisations can opt into voluntary reporting.","Olwo, twekenneenya enjawulo mu nsasula ya CEO n’ekikula ky’abantu era obunene bw’enyingiza y’ebibiina byakulembera ebibiina ebirina abakozi 250 mu Bungereza mu mateeka bye byetaagibwa okutegeeza gavumenti ya Bungereza ey’omukisa gw’omusaala gw’ekikula ky’abantu buli mwaka, ate ebibiina ebitono bisobola okusalawo mu lipoota ey’obwannakyewa."
"For organisations in our sampling frame that have a presence in the UK, we extracted their gender pay gap data from 2017 to 2023 from the UK Gender Pay Gap Service website, including mean and median percentage differences in hourly rate pay and bonus pay, percentages of women in different pay quartiles and percentages of women receiving bonus pay.","Ku bibiina ebiri mu nkola yaffe ey’okutwala sampuli ebirina okubeerawo mu Bungereza, twaggyayo ebikwata ku kituli ky’omusaala gw’ekikula ky’abantu okuva mu 2017 okutuuka mu 2023 okuva ku mukutu gwa UK Gender Pay Gap Service website, omuli enjawulo za wakati n’ebitundu eby’omu makkati mu bitundu by’omusaala gwa buli ssaawa n’okusasula bbonuusi, ebitundu by’abakyala mu bitundu eby’enjawulo eby’okusasula n’ebitundu ku kikumi eby’abakyala abafuna bbonuusi."
"The methods described above were approved by the ethics committee of Strengths and limitations As far as we know, this is the only systematic attempt to assess how gender is understood and practised by organisations working in and/or influencing the field of global health across multiple dimensions (commitment, workplace policy content, gender and geography of leadership and genderresponsive programming).","Enkola ezoogeddwako waggulu zayisibwa akakiiko akakwasisa empisa akalaga amaanyi n’obuzibu nga bwe tumanyi, kino kye kigezo kyokka eky’enteekateeka okwekenneenya engeri ekikula ky’omuntu gye kitegeerekeka n’okukolebwamu ebibiina ebikola mu ne/oba ebifuga ekitundu ky’ebyobulamu mu nsi yonna mu bitundu ebingi (okwewaayo, ebirimu mu nkola y’emirimu, ekikula ky’abantu n’enkula y’obukulembeze n’enteekateeka z’ekikula ky’abantu)."
"While our efforts may have omitted relevant measures and do not include all active organisations, this method provides the opportunity to measure status quo and report on organisations progress.","Wadde nga kaweefube waffe ayinza okuba nga yalekawo ebipimo ebikwatagana era nga temuli bibiina byonna ebikola, enkola eno etuwa omukisa okupima embeera eriwo n’okukola lipoota ku nkulaakulana y’ebibiina."
This method has allowed us to shine a light on the state of gender equality in global health and organisations across all sectors have begun to respond to our call.,Enkola eno etusobozesezza okwaka ekitangaala ku mbeera y’okwenkanankana kw’ekikula ky’abantu mu by’obulamu n’ebibiina by’ensi yonna mu bitundu byonna bitandise okuddamu omulanga gwaffe.
We believe that the collection of data and information for measurement and accountability is a fundamental first step to GH5050 has developed a rigorous methodology that is consistent with established systematic review research methods.,Tukkiriza nti okukung’aanya ebikwata ku bipimo n’okuvunaanyizibwa ku mutendera ogusooka ku GH5050 kukoze enkola enkakali ekwatagana n’enkola z’okunoonyereza eziteereddwawo ez’okunoonyereza.

"The collaboration between the WHO Global NTD Programme and the WHO Health Emergencies Programme is being strengthened, notably in the areas of outbreak-prone NTDs and dracunculiasis eradication, and, in general, for the maintenance of NTD essential services in the context of health emergencies.","Enkolagana wakati wa WHO Global NTD Program ne WHO Health Emergencies Program enywezebwa, naddala mu bitundu bya NTD ezitera okubutuka n’okumalawo dracunculiasis, era, okutwalira awamu, okukuuma NTD essential services mu mbeera y’obulamu obw’amangu."
Two specific issues have been identified for facilitating the inclusion of NTDs within national health systems: positioning NTDs within universal health coverage and mainstreaming NTDs data into the national health information system.,Ensonga bbiri ezenjawulo zizuuliddwa okusobola okwanguyiza okussa NTDs mu nkola z’ebyobulamu mu ggwanga: okuteeka NTDs mu kifo ky’ebyobulamu eby’ensi yonna n’okussa mu nkola ebikwata ku NTDS mu nkola y’amawulire g’ebyobulamu mu ggwanga.
"At the global level, this effort is reflected in having the NTD community actively participate in high-level discussions on primary health care and universal health coverage, as well as in ensuring that NTDs are part of WHOs corporate effort to strengthen routine health information systems, with the aim of facilitating the roll-out of data collection platforms and tools to enable a consistent flow and use of information on all indicators for each NTD.","Ku mutendera gw’ensi yonna, kaweefube ono yeeyolekera mu kuba n’ekibiina kya NTD okwenyigira ennyo mu kukubaganya ebirowoozo okw’omutindo ogwa waggulu ku by’obulamu ebisookerwako n’okubunyisa obulamu bw’ebyobulamu obw’ensi yonna, awamu n’okulaba nti NTDs kitundu kya kaweefube w’ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu okunyweza enkola z’amawulire agakwata ku bulamu eza bulijjo, n’ekigendererwa eky’okuyamba okuyiringisiza enkola y’okukung’aanya amawulire n’ebikozesebwa okusobozesa okutambula n’okukozesa okutambula obutasalako n’okukozesa amawulire ku bipimo byonna ku buli NTD."

"While progress has been slower than anticipated, there is optimistic confidence in bridging the gap and returning to the planned trajectory towards 2030.","Wadde ng’enkulaakulana ebadde mpola okusinga bwe kyali kisuubirwa, waliwo obwesige obw’essuubi mu kuziba ekituli n’okudda mu nteekateeka etegekeddwa okutuuka mu mwaka gwa 2030."
Successes in the global fight against NTDs are being achieved in spite of persisting and new challenges.,Obuwanguzi mu kulwanyisa NTDs mu nsi yonna butuukirizibwa wadde nga waliwo okusoomoozebwa okupya era okupya.

"NTDs must be firmly repositioned within the global health architecture, given that interventions against these diseases can contribute to a wide range of ancillary benefits to other programmes within and beyond the health sector.","NTDs zirina okuddamu okuteekebwa mu kifo mu nzimba y’ebyobulamu mu nsi yonna, okusinziira ku ngeri okuyingira mu nsonga z’endwadde zino gye kuyinza okuyamba ku migaso egy’enjawulo egy’okuyambako eri enteekateeka endala mu kitongole ky’ebyobulamu n’okusukkawo."

"The main drivers of reduction in the number of people requiring interventions are the progressive attainment of end-point programmatic targets (interruption of transmission, elimination as a public health problem) by countries, the achievement of post-intervention surveillance status, and the reclassification of endemic areas from requiring to not requiring interventions because of improvement of epidemiological conditions or access to water and sanitation.","Ebikulu ebivaako okukendeeza ku muwendo gw’abantu abeetaaga okuyingira mu nsonga zino kwe kutuuka ku biruubirirwa by’enteekateeka eby’enkomerero (okutaataaganyizibwa kw’okubunyisa, okuggyawo ng’ekizibu ky’ebyobulamu by’abantu bonna) amawanga, okutuukiriza embeera y’okulondoola oluvannyuma lw’okuyingira mu nsonga, n’okuddamu okugabanya ebitundu ebibeera mu bitundu eby’enjawulo okwetaaga obutayingiramu kuyingirira kubanga embeera z’okulongoosa mu ndwadde oba okutuuka ku mazzi n’okugenda mu mazzi."

"However, to achieve this indicator, missing criteria and acknowledgement processes for all diseases targeted for eradication, elimination and elimination as a public health problem need to be established; and NTD-endemic countries that have not yet completed any acknowledgment process should be encouraged to scale up interventions against NTDs and compile evidence demonstrating the attainment of the set target, as relevant.","Naye, okutuukiriza kino ekiraga, emisingi egibula n’enkola z’okukkiriza endwadde zonna ezigendereddwamu okumalawo, okuggyawo n’okumalawo ng’ekizibu ky’ebyobulamu by’abantu kyetaagisa okuteekebwawo; ne NTD-endemic countries ezitannaba kumaliriza nkola yonna ey’okukkiriza zirina okukubiriza okulinnyisa ebikolwa ku NTDs n’okukung’aanya obujulizi obulaga okutuuka ku kiruubirirwa ekiteereddwawo, nga bwe kikwatagana."

"Since 2022, the Intra-Country Coordination Committee for NTDs (ICCC) within the Ghana Health Service has been working on expanding the NHIS coverage for NTDs with support from the USAIDs Act to End NTDs | West Program.","Okuva mu mwaka gwa 2022, akakiiko akakwasaganya eggwanga aka NTDS (ICCC) mu kitongole ky’ebyobulamu mu Ghana kabadde kakola ku kugaziya NHIS coverage ya NTDs n’obuwagizi okuva mu tteeka lya USAIDS okukomya NTDS | WEST program."
A comprehensive desk review was performed following a meeting in June to sensitize stakeholders on the framework for expanding the NHIS benefits package with respect to NTD services.,Okwekenenya okujjuvu ku mmeeza kwakolebwa oluvannyuma lw’olukiiko mu June okumanyisa abakwatibwako ku nkola y’okugaziya enkola ya NHIS benefits package ku bikwata ku mpeereza za NTD.
This was followed by technical consultations to develop a comprehensive costing framework to guide the inclusion of NTD services within the NHIS benefits packages and revision of all NTD management protocols for for the revision of Ghanas Essential Medicines List and NHIS benefits package.,Kino kyaddirirwa okwebuuza ku by’ekikugu okukola enkola enzijuvu ey’okusaasaanya ssente okulungamya okussaamu empeereza za NTD mu nkola z’emikisa gya NHIS n’okuddamu okutunula mu nkola zonna ez’okuddukanya NTD for for the revision of Ghanas Essential Medicines List and NHIS benefits package.
ICCC has facilitated a high-level consultation with decision-makers to seek commitment to including new NTD services within NHIS and shared a policy brief and formal request to complete the expansion of the NHIS benefits packages.,ICCC eyanguyiza okwebuuza okw’amaanyi n’abasalawo okunoonya okwewaayo okussaamu obuweereza bwa NTD obupya mu NHIS era ne bagabana okusaba mu bufunze kw’enkola n’omutongole okumaliriza okugaziya enkola z’emikisa gya NHIS.
This landmark was achieved through systematic data-driven advocacy.,Ekifo kino eky’enkizo kyatuukibwako nga bayita mu kubunyisa amawulire nga kikulemberwa data.
"A landscape analysis was conducted to identify the relevant stakeholders, determine the existing barriers and design applicable strategies targeting effective domestic resource mobilization.","Okwekenenya enkula y’ensi kwakolebwa okuzuula abakwatibwako, okuzuula ebiziyiza ebiriwo n’okukola enkola ezikozesebwa ezigenderera okukungaanya eby’obugagga eby’omu maka okulungi."
A tool for enhancing resource mobilization and allocation for NTDs in districts has been developed and NTDs.,Ekintu eky’okutumbula okukungaanya eby’obugagga n’okugaba NTDS mu disitulikiti kikoleddwa era NTDS.
Discussions are ongoing on the results of this exercise and how it will feed into future workplans.,Okukubaganya ebirowoozo kugenda mu maaso ku biva mu dduyiro ono n’engeri gy’anaalyamu enteekateeka z’emirimu mu biseera eby’omu maaso.
"Unlike some high-profile diseases or intervention programmes that have a pooled funding mechanism, NTD programmes have diverse and often one-disease international donors.","Okwawukana ku ndwadde ezimu ez’amaanyi oba enteekateeka z’okuyingira mu nsonga ezirina enkola y’okugaba ensimbi ezikuŋŋaanyiziddwa, enteekateeka za NTD zirina abagabi b’obuyambi ab’enjawulo mu nsi yonna era emirundi mingi."
"Nevertheless, the financing difficulties faced by WHOs Global NTD Programme could be representative of the wider picture: since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Programme has faced funding withdrawal or cuts from several major donors, which continue to cause severe budget restrictions and have led to a significant reduction in workforce.","Wadde kiri kityo, ebizibu by’ensimbi ebituuka ku nteekateeka ya WOS Global NTD biyinza okukiikirira ekifaananyi ekigazi: Okuva ssennyiga omukambwe eya Covid-19 lwe yatandika, enteekateeka eno efunye okuggyibwako ssente oba okusala ku bagabi b’obuyambi abakulu abawerako, ekigenda mu maaso n’okuleeta obukwakkulizo obw’amaanyi mu mbalirira era nga kivuddeko okukendeeza ennyo ku bakozi."
"The findings revealed significant funding gaps1 for MDA planned in 2024 against lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminthiases: depending on the disease, 10% to 35% of the implementation units were found to be without secure funding to cover the cost of their planned MDA campaign.","Ebizuuliddwa byalaga ebituli ebinene eby’ensimbi1 eri MDA eyategekebwa mu 2024 okulwanyisa obulwadde bwa lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, n’endwadde z’ensiri ezitambuza ettaka: okusinziira ku bulwadde, ebitundu 10% ku 35% ku bifo eby’okussa mu nkola byazuulibwa nga tebirina nsimbi za bukuumi okusobola okusasula ssente za MDA."
"The funding gap for monitoring and evaluation activities was even more pronounced, ranging from 11% to 46%.","Ekituli mu nsimbi eky’emirimu gy’okulondoola n’okwekenneenya kyali kya maanyi nnyo, okuva ku bitundu 11% okutuuka ku bitundu 46%."
Data from 29 low and lower-middle-income countries in 2018 were used to illustrate national investment in NTD programmes in the Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2023 .,Ebiwandiiko okuva mu mawanga 29 aga wansi n’aga wansi aga wakati mu 2018 byakozesebwa okulaga ensimbi z’eggwanga mu nteekateeka za NTD mu lipoota y’ensi yonna ku ndwadde z’omu bitundu eby’obutiti ezisuuliriddwa 2023 .
"However, since 2018, the number of countries reporting fully disaggregated health expenditure data by disease (including NTDs) has been decreasing quickly.","Wabula okuva mu mwaka gwa 2018, omuwendo gw’amawanga agaloopa mu bujjuvu ebikwata ku nsaasaanya y’ensimbi mu by’obulamu olw’obulwadde (nga mw’otwalidde ne NTDs) gubadde gukendeera mangu."
"In 2020, only six countries reported expenditure on NTDs, including zero expenditure, in the GHED, which is not sufficient to constitute a representative sample for Lack of economic data has become a key obstacle to effective advocacy for investing in NTD interventions.","Mu mwaka gwa 2020, amawanga mukaaga gokka ge gaategeeza nti ensaasaanya ku NTDs, omuli n’ensaasaanya ya zero, mu GHED, etamala kukola sampuli ekiikirira olw’obutaba na bikwata ku by’enfuna kifuuse ekizibu ekikulu mu kubunyisa ssente mu ngeri ennungi ey’okuteeka ssente mu kuyingiza NTD."
"One way to address this, without overburdening countries, is to support countries in recording their national expenditure on NTD programmes through a health account exercise with full disease disaggregation; that is, an accounting framework for systematically tracking health spending.","Engeri emu ey’okukola ku kino, awatali nsi ezisukkiridde, kwe kuwagira amawanga mu kuwandiika ensaasaanya yaago ey’eggwanga ku nteekateeka za NTD nga bayita mu mulimu gwa akawunti y’ebyobulamu nga gulimu okugabanya endwadde mu bujjuvu; Kwe kugamba, enkola y’okubala ebitabo ey’okulondoola ensaasaanya y’ensimbi mu nkola y’ebyobulamu."
"In parallel, at regional and country level, WHO has also intensified work towards generating economic information for resource mobilization.","Mu kukwatagana, ku mutendera gw’ekitundu n’eggwanga, era nga naye ayongedde okukola emirimu egy’okukola amawulire agakwata ku by’enfuna okukungaanya eby’obugagga."
"This initiative was accompanied by a financial resource requirement plan encompassing nine countries.1 The plan included estimates of the cost for implementing priority interventions recommended by WHO in the target countries during the period .2 To evaluate the feasibility, added value and impact of integrating interventions directed against different NTDs, WHO also supported a pilot activity in Cte d. Ivoire aimed at integrating screening for skin NTDs into a planned MDA campaign against schistosomiasis.","Enteekateeka eno yali ewerekerwako enteekateeka eyeetaaga eby’obugagga ebizingiramu amawanga mwenda.1 Enteekateeka eno yalimu okubalirira kw’omuwendo gw’ensimbi ezisaasaanyizibwa mu kuteeka mu nkola enkola z’okukulembeza eziteeseddwa WHO mu nsi ezigendereddwamu mu kiseera .2 okwekenneenya obusobozi, omugaso ogwongezeddwaako n’enkosa y’okugatta okugatta okulwanyisa NTD ez’enjawulo, nga nabo bawagira omulimu gw’okugezesa mu CTE d.

The integrated intervention was successfully conducted in  in two districts in Cte d. Ivoire.,Okuyingira mu nsonga mu ngeri ey’omuggundu kwakolebwa bulungi mu disitulikiti bbiri mu Cote d’Ivoire.
The data on the cost and impact of such integration have been collected and are currently being analysed in view of their dissemination.,Ebikwata ku nsaasaanya n’enkosa y’okugatta ng’okwo bikuŋŋaanyiziddwa era mu kiseera kino byekenneenyezebwa okusinziira ku kubunyisa kwazo.

Conclusions and way forward NTD programmes were severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis.,Ebimalirizibwa n’engeri enteekateeka za NTD ez’okugenda mu maaso zakosebwa nnyo ekizibu kya COVID-19.
"During the earliest phases of the pandemic, prevention, treatment and care services for NTDs were the second most frequently disrupted across the entire health system spectrum, after those targeting mental, neurological and substance use disorders, and were the most affected in terms of the proportion of countries reporting severe disruptions.","Mu mitendera egyasooka egy’obuweereza bwa ssennyiga omukambwe, okuziyiza, okujjanjaba n’okulabirira NTDs ze zaali ez’okubiri okusinga okutaataaganyizibwa mu nkola yonna ey’enkola y’ebyobulamu, oluvannyuma lw’abo abatunuulidde obuzibu bw’omutwe, obusimu n’okukozesa ebiragalalagala, era nga ze zaasinga okukosebwa mu kitundu ky’amawanga agategeeza okutaataaganyizibwa okw’amaanyi."
"Community-based interventions, health-facility-based activities and capacity to respond to NTD outbreaks were jeopardized, resulting in lower numbers of people suffering from these diseases being detected and treated, and reduced coverage rates for interventions such as preventive chemotherapy.","Okuyingira mu nsonga mu kitundu, emirimu egyesigama ku bulamu n‟obusobozi bw‟okuddamu okubutuka kwa NTD byateekebwa mu matigga, ekyavaamu omuwendo omutono ogw‟abantu abatawaanyizibwa endwadde zino okuzuulibwa n‟okujjanjabibwa, n‟okukendeeza ku miwendo gy‟okubikka ku bikolwa nga okuziyiza eddagala."
The need for resources required to accompany a full post-COVID-19 recovery has increased.,Obwetaavu bw’ebikozesebwa ebyetaagisa okuwerekera ku kudda engulu mu bujjuvu oluvannyuma lwa COVID-19 bweyongedde.
"While it may have been expected that the progressive decrease in the public health relevance of the COVID-19 pandemic would see a return to normal funding levels, this has not happened for NTD programmes, despite several advocacy events being held in 2022 and 2023.","Wadde nga kiyinza okuba nga kyali kisuubirwa nti okukendeera okugenda mu maaso mu bukulu bw’ebyobulamu mu by’obulamu bw’abantu bonna COVID-19 kwandirabye okudda ku mitendera egy’ensimbi egya bulijjo, kino tekibaddewo ku pulogulaamu za NTD, wadde ng’emikolo gy’okubunyisa amawulire egy’enjawulo gibaddewo mu 2022 ne 2023."
"As of , the financial support available to NTD programmes is still far below pre-pandemic levels and is still limited at all levels.","As of , obuyambi bw’ensimbi obuliwo eri pulogulaamu za NTD bukyali wansi nnyo wansi w’emitendera egy’okusooka okugwa mu kibonerezo era nga kikyali kitono ku mitendera gyonna."
"This is jeopardizing programme activities, hampering meaningful planning, and preventing effective coordination globally and regionally.","Kino kwe kuteeka mu matigga emirimu gya pulogulaamu, okulemesa enteekateeka ey’amakulu, n’okuziyiza okukwatagana okulungi mu nsi yonna ne mu kitundu."
Challenges likewise are not limited to a slow post.,Okusoomoozebwa mu ngeri y’emu tekukoma ku post egenda mpola.
COVID-19 recovery: persistent gaps in knowledge and operational tools are preventing the development or production of programme-ready diagnostics and more effective treatments and vaccines.,COVID-19 Recovery: Ebituli ebitaggwaawo mu kumanya n’ebikozesebwa mu kukola biziyiza okukola oba okukola okukebera n’okugema obulungi enteekateeka n’okugema obulungi.
"These gaps are also hampering the fully-fledged implementation of surveillance, vector control, veterinary public health and WASH interventions, as well as the adaptation of strategic approaches to global challenges such as climate change.","Ebituli bino era biremesezza enkola y’okulondoola okulondoola, okufuga ebiwuka, ebyobulamu by’ebisolo n’okunaaba mu ngeri ey’enjawulo, wamu n’okukyusa enkola ez’obukodyo mu kusoomoozebwa kw’ensi yonna ng’enkyukakyuka y’obudde."
This may have a significant negative impact on consolidated epidemiological scenarios and jeopardize health gains made to date.,Kino kiyinza okuba n’akakwate akabi ak’amaanyi ku mbeera z’obulwadde ezisaasaana n’okuteeka mu matigga amagoba g’ebyobulamu agakoleddwa okutuusa kati.
"Suboptimal technical and programmatic capacity in some national programmes has been noted, as has a lack of, or weak, cross-sectoral engagement to address the key NTD determinants that require multisectoral collaboration.","Obusobozi bw’ebyekikugu n’enteekateeka mu nteekateeka z’eggwanga ezimu bubadde bumanyiddwa, nga bwe kibadde n’obutaba na nkolagana ya bitundu bya NTD ebikulu, oba enafu, okukola ku nsonga enkulu eza NTD ezeetaaga okukolagana mu bitongole ebitali bimu."
"Lagging government ownership is resulting in insufficient coordination, inefficient use of resources, inadequate funding and slow adoption of new NTD interventions, while conflict and humanitarian crises are affecting programme implementation and progress and heightening the risk of NTDs in affected populations.","Obwannannyini bwa gavumenti obusigadde emabega kivaamu obutakwatagana bumala, okukozesa obulungi eby’obugagga, ensimbi ezitamala n’okutwala empola enkola empya eza NTD, ate enkaayana n’ebizibu by’abantu bikosa okussa mu nkola enteekateeka n’okukulaakulana n’okwongera ku bulabe bwa NTDS mu bantu abakoseddwa."
A particular example is the steady but insufficient progress being made in the reduction in the number of people requiring interventions against NTDs.,Ekyokulabirako ekimu kwe kukulaakulana okunywevu naye nga tekumala mu kukendeeza ku muwendo gw’abantu abeetaaga okuyingira mu nsonga ku NTDS.
"Conversely, good progress has been made for the number of countries acknowledged for having eliminated at least one NTD , and for the total number of acknowledgement processes completed .","Okwawukana ku ekyo, enkulaakulana ennungi ekoleddwa ku muwendo gw’amawanga agakkirizibwa olw’okumalawo waakiri NTD emu , n’omuwendo gwonna ogw’enkola z’okukkiriza eziwedde ."
"Six countries were acknowledged in 2023, including Bangladesh, for two diseases.","Amawanga mukaaga ge gaakkirizibwa mu 2023 nga kuliko ne Bangladesh, olw’endwadde bbiri."
The fact that 13 countries (as of ) have eliminated more than one NTD is cause for celebration.,"Eky’okuba nti amawanga 13 (nga ) gamaze okuggyawo NTD ezisukka mu emu, kivaako okujaguza."
Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 There are limitations in tracking some of the indicators included in the M&Eframework.,Global Report on Neglected Tropical Diseases 2024 Waliwo obuzibu mu kulondoola ebimu ku bipimo ebiteekeddwa mu M&Eframework.
"DALYs data relating to NTDs are challenging, in terms of both their completeness and their timeliness, and there are difficulties associated with collecting reliable data on a number of NTDs.","Dalys data ezikwata ku NTDs zirimu okusoomoozebwa, mu ngeri y’obujjuvu bwazo n’obudde bwazo, era waliwo obuzibu obukwatagana n’okukung’aanya data eyesigika ku muwendo gwa NTDs."
"Cross-cutting indicator6: Share of the population at risk protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure due to neglected tropical diseases Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) can be very expensive to treat, especially in their late stages.",Cross-cutting indicator6: Omugabo gw’abantu abali mu bulabe ogukuumibwa okuva ku nsaasaanya y’obulamu obw’akatyabaga okuva mu nsawo olw’endwadde ez’omu bitundu eby’obutiti ezisuuliriddwa endwadde z’omu bitundu eby’obutiti (NTDS) ziyinza okuba ez’ebbeeyi ennyo okujjanjaba naddala mu biseera byabwe ebisembayo.
Monitoring of progress towards this indicator has been facing data challenges.,Okulondoola enkulaakulana eri mu kipimo kino kibadde kyolekagana n’okusoomoozebwa kwa data.
There is no mechanism at country level to collect household expenditure on the costs of treatment for NTDs.,Tewali nkola ku mutendera gwa nsi okusolooza ensaasaanya y’awaka ku nsaasaanya y’obujjanjabi eri NTDs.
"As a result, existing data sources were used as proxies to calculate the financial risk faced by the NTD community, with the limitation that calculations focus not on health expenditure due to NTDs but rather on any health expenditure among Financial protection against health expenditure is at the core of universal health coverage, and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 3.8.2 monitors the health-related financial hardship faced by a population.1 When household expenditure on health exceeds a certain percentage of the total household expenditure or income, it will be considered catastrophic.","N’ekyavaamu, ensibuko z’ebiwandiiko eziriwo zaakozesebwa ng’ebikakasa okubala akabi k’ensimbi akali mu kibiina kya NTD, nga okukomya okubala kussa essira ku nsaasaanya y’ebyobulamu olw’ensaasaanya ya NTDs wabula ku nsaasaanya yonna ey’ebyobulamu mu kukuuma eby’ensimbi okuva ku nsaasaanya y’ensimbi ku nsonga enkulu ey’okubunyisa obulamu bw’abantu, n’ekiruubirirwa ky’enkulaakulana ey’olubeerera (SDG) Ekiraga 3.8.2 Okulondoola kw’ebyobulamu ku ndwadde y’obulamu ku ndwadde y’abantu ku ndwadde y’abantu ku mukolo gw’okulinnyisa 1. Ebitundu ebimu ku buli kikumi eby’ensaasaanya y’awaka oba enyingiza yonna, kijja kutwalibwa ng’eky’akatyabaga."
"Two thresholds for SDG 3.8.2 have been proposed: 10% or As populations at risk of NTDs often have low capacity to pay, the lower threshold was chosen; the percentage of population with household expenditures on health greater than 10% of total household expenditure or Definition of SDG 3.8.2: Proportion of the population with large household expenditure on health as a share of total household expenditure or income.","Emitendera ebiri egya SDG 3.8.2 giteeseddwa: 10% oba ng’abantu abali mu bulabe bwa NTDs batera okuba n’obusobozi obutono okusasula, omusingi ogwa wansi gwalondebwa; Ebitundu by’abantu abalina ensaasaanya y’awaka ku bulamu obusukka mu bitundu 10% ku nsaasaanya yonna ey’awaka oba ennyonyola ya SDG 3.8.2: Ekitundu ky’abantu abalina ensaasaanya ennene ey’awaka ku bulamu ng’omugabo gw’ensaasaanya yonna ey’awaka oba enyingiza."
Two thresholds are used to define large household expenditure on health: greater than 10% and greater than 25% of total household expenditure or income .,Emitendera ebiri gikozesebwa okunnyonnyola ensaasaanya ennene ey’awaka ku bulamu: esinga ebitundu 10% n’ebisukka mu 25% ku nsaasaanya oba enyingiza yonna ey’awaka .
The proxy of the population at risk of NTDs is SDG 3.3.5: Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases.,Okukiikirira omuwendo gw’abantu abali mu bulabe bwa NTDS ye SDG 3.3.5: Omuwendo gw’abantu abeetaaga okuyingira mu nsonga ku ndwadde z’omu bitundu eby’obutiti ezisuuliriddwa.
"When this calculation was made, SDG 3.3.5 data were updated to 2021.","Okubala kuno bwe kwakolebwa, data ya SDG 3.3.5 yalongoosebwa okutuuka mu 2021."
"Data for SDG 3.8.2, however, are often not available annually across countries.","Ebiwandiiko bya SDG 3.8.2, naye, bitera obutabaawo buli mwaka mu nsi yonna."
"If the time dimension is added, equation 1 would be modified as follows: i (SDG 3.8.2i, latest year  SDG 3.3.5i, 2021) Based on equation 2, in 2021, 12.6% of the global population at risk of NTDs encountered catastrophic health spending: that is, 87.4% of the population at risk of NTDs was protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure.","Singa ekipimo ky’ekiseera kyongerwako, ensengekera 1 yandibadde ekyusibwa bweti: I (SDG 3.8.2i, omwaka ogusembyeyo SDG 3.3.5i, 2021) okusinziira ku nsengekera 2, mu 2021, 12.6% ku bungi bw’abantu mu nsi yonna mu bulabe bwa NTDS esisinkanye mu katyabaga k’abantu abaali bafunye obuzibu bw’okulwala akabi akali mu katyabaga k’abantu abali mu bulabe bw’okulwala akalulu kalimu akabi akali mu bulabe bwa NTDSTSTSHOTHPHOTHPHOCH. Ensaasaanya y’ensimbi ezitali za mu nsawo."
The above calculations should be interpreted with caution.,Okubalirira waggulu kulina okutaputibwa n’obwegendereza.
"For example, SDG 3.8.2 data are often not recent.","Okugeza, data ya SDG 3.8.2 etera obutaba ya nnaku zino."
"However, if the 36 countries with SDG 3.8.2 data older than 10 years are removed from the analysis, the","Naye singa amawanga 36 agalina SDG 3.8.2 data agasukka mu myaka 10 gaggyibwa mu kwekenneenya,"
"Additionally, by using SDG 3.8.2 as a proxy for the financial risk faced by the population at risk of NTDs, it is assumed that such population has the same financial risk as the national average.","Okugatta ku ekyo, nga tukozesa SDG 3.8.2 ng’ekiikirira akabi k’ensimbi eri abantu abali mu bulabe bwa NTDS, kiteeberezebwa nti omuwendo gw’abantu ng’ogwo gulina akabi k’ensimbi kye kimu nga average y’eggwanga."
"However, populations living in poverty, such as those affected by NTDs, are often more vulnerable to financial risk, and SDG 3.8.2 could therefore underestimate the financial risk of the population affected by NTDs.","Naye, abantu ababeera mu bwavu, gamba ng’abo abakoseddwa NTDs, batera okubeera mu bulabe bw’ensimbi, era SDG 3.8.2 n’olwekyo bayinza okunyooma akabi k’ensimbi ak’abantu abakoseddwa NTDS."
"The international poverty line currently used by the World Bank is US$2.15 To apply this approach, SDG 3.8.2 was replaced in equation 2 by the share of the population pushed below the US$2.15 per person per day poverty line due to household health expenditure.","Omulongooti gw’obwavu mu nsi yonna mu kiseera kino gukozesebwa mu kiseera kino gwa doola za Amerika 2.15 okukozesa enkola eno, SDG 3.8.2 yakyusibwa mu nsengekera 2 n’omugabo gw’abantu abaasindikibwa wansi wa doola za Amerika 2.15 buli muntu buli lunaku obwavu olw’ensaasaanya y’ensimbi mu bulamu bw’awaka."
"Data older than 10 years were deleted, resulting in a database of 114countries.","Data enkadde okusinga emyaka 10 yasazibwamu, ekyavaamu database ya 114countries."
"According to this calculation, in 2021, globally, people at risk of NTDs were pushed below the poverty line by their health expenditure.","Okusinziira ku kubala kuno, mu 2021, mu nsi yonna, abantu abali mu bulabe bwa NTDS baanyigirizibwa wansi w’omuggo gw’obwavu olw’ensaasaanya yaabwe ey’ebyobulamu."
"This approach has an additional limitation: since it focuses on the population living close to the poverty line, it can only be used to complement SDG 3.8.2; it cannot replace the first approach detailed above.","Enkola eno erina ekkomo eddala: Okuva bwe kiri nti essira erisinga kulissa ku bantu ababeera okumpi n’omuggo gw’obwavu, esobola okukozesebwa okujjuliza SDG 3.8.2 yokka; Tekisobola kudda mu kifo ky’enkola esooka eragiddwa waggulu."
"The indicator population pushed further below the poverty line by household health expenditures needs further refinement, such as more data quality checks, and understanding before it can be used as a proxy for the population at risk of NTDs.","Omuwendo gw’abantu abalaga nti omuwendo gw’abantu mu bulamu bw’awaka gunyigiriza ebyetaago ebirala eby’okwongera okulongoosa, gamba ng’okukebera omutindo gw’ebikwata ku bantu, n’okutegeera nga tebinnaba kukozesebwa ng’ekiikirira abantu abali mu bulabe bwa NTDS."

"While international donors and health agencies have increased investment in ICT to support Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) in recent years, these investments have often resulted in a proliferation of pilot efforts rather than efforts to scale projects.","Wadde ng’abawaayo ssente mu nsi yonna n’ebitongole by’ebyobulamu byeyongedde okussa ssente mu ICT okuwagira enkola z’ebyobulamu (HSS) mu myaka egiyise, ssente zino zitera okuvaamu okusaasaana kw’okufuba okw’okugezesa okusinga okufuba okulinnyisa pulojekiti."
"Digital health systems and applications are often developed and implemented ad hoc, to meet the immediate requirements of specific activities or projects, with a limited focus on scalability.","Enkola z’ebyobulamu eza digito n’okukozesebwa bitera okukolebwa era ne biteekebwa mu nkola eby’ekiseera, okutuukiriza ebyetaago eby’amangu eby’emirimu oba pulojekiti ezenjawulo, nga essira liteekeddwa nnyo ku kukulaakulana."

The majority of the innovations have focused on the adoption of new products or services by individuals and their market-driven diffusion to the population at large.,Ebisinga obungi ku biyiiya bino bibadde bitunuulidde okwettanira ebintu oba obuweereza obupya abantu ssekinnoomu n’okusaasaana kwabyo nga bakulemberwa akatale eri abantu okutwaliza awamu.
These innovations have typically emerged from negotiations between diverse stakeholders who compete to impose or at least prioritise their preferred version of that innovation.,Ebiyiiya bino mu ngeri entuufu bivudde mu nteeseganya wakati w’abakwatibwako ab’enjawulo abavuganya okussaawo oba waakiri okukulembeza enkyusa yaabwe ey’obuyiiya obwo gye baagala.

"Whereas EMHS have obvious medical and economic importance, there are still widespread problems with lack of access, poor quality, irrational use and wastage(ibid).","So nga EMHS erina obukulu obweyoleka mu by‟obujjanjabi n‟ebyenfuna, wakyaliwo ebizibu ebibunye ennyo olw‟obutafuna, omutindo omubi, okukozesa okutali kwa magezi n‟okusaasaanya(ibid)."
An important aspect in the realization of this mission is the availability and proper use of EMHS.,Ekintu ekikulu mu kutuukiriza omulimu guno kwe kubeerawo n’okukozesa obulungi EMHS.
"An efficient and effective supply chain system of EMHS is, therefore, of paramountimportance.","Enkola ennungamu era ennungi ey’okugaba ebintu mu EMHS, n’olwekyo, ya Paramountimportance."

"The draft policy is presented to a relevant technical working Group (TWG) meeting e.g Medicines Procurement and Management (MPM), Governance, Standards, Policy and Regulations (GOSPOR) etc for further scrutiny and advice.","Ebbago ly’enkola lyanjulwa eri ekibiina ekikwatagana eky’ebyekikugu (TWG) olukiiko e.g eddagala okugula n’okuddukanya (MPM), enfuga, emitendera, enkola n’ebiragiro (GOSPOR) etc okwongera okwekenneenya n’okubuulirira."
The draft policy is further presented to the Senior Management for scrutiny and discussion.,Ebbago ly’enkola eno lyongera okwanjulwa eri abakulu mu kitongole okwekenneenya n’okukubaganya ebirowoozo.
"At this level, several other observations are made that require changes in the first draft.","Ku mutendera guno, okwetegereza okulala okuwerako kukolebwa nga kwetaaga enkyukakyuka mu bbago erisooka."
"This is a forum for the Government, Health Development Partners (HDPs) and other stakeholders established to receive and discuss health policy and to advise on the implementation of the policies.","Guno gwe mukutu gwa gavumenti, abakolagana n’okutumbula ebyobulamu (HDPs) n’abakwatibwako abalala abateekebwawo okufuna n’okukubaganya ebirowoozo ku nkola y’ebyobulamu n’okuwabula ku nkola y’okussa mu nkola enkola."
"HPAC may also make someobservations on the draft policy document, proposes changes and recommendations moving forward.","HPAC era eyinza okukola ebimu ku bikulu ku bbago ly’ekiwandiiko ky’enkola, eteesa ku nkyukakyuka n’ebiteeso ebigenda mu maaso."
"Once these changes are made in the draft policy to the satisfaction of the HPAC, members endorse the policy in its current form and recommends it for the next level of approval- Top Management.","Enkyukakyuka zino bwe zimala okukolebwa mu bbago ly’enkola y’okumatiza HPAC, bammemba bawagira enkola eno mu ngeri gyeri kati era ne bagiwa amagezi ku ddaala eddala ery’abaddukanya emirimu egy’oku ntikko."
The Top Management is the highest level organ in the responsible for policy decisions.,Abaddukanya emirimu egy’oku ntikko kye kitongole eky’omutendera ogw’oku ntikko mu kusalawo ku nkola.
It critically reviews the provisions of the draft policy and may also propose changes to the draft policy.,Etunuulira nnyo ebiragiro ebiri mu bbago ly’enkola era eyinza n’okuteesa ku nkyukakyuka mu bbago ly’enkola.
"Again, once the proposed changes are made in the draft policy to the satisfaction of the Top Policy Management, the latter approves the policy.","Nate, enkyukakyuka eziteeseddwa bwe zikolebwa mu bbago ly’enkola okumatiza enzirukanya y’enkola ey’oku ntikko, ekyo eky’oluvannyuma kikkiriza enkola."
"In case of any controversial issues in the draft policy, the Top Management may refer the draft policy to the Senior Top Management for discussion and once it is addressed, the policy can be finally approved at thatlevel.","Mu mbeera y’ensonga zonna ezirimu okusika omuguwa mu bbago ly’enkola, abaddukanya emirimu ab’oku ntikko bayinza okujuliza ebbago ly’enkola eri abakulu abakulu mu kukubaganya ebirowoozo era bwe kimala okutunulwamu, enkola esobola okusembayo okukkirizibwa ku ddaala eryo."
It is imperative to note that some policies may require parliamentary and cabinet approvals depending on their sensitivity to public safety as well as public expenditure.,Kikulu nnyo okukimanya nti enkola ezimu ziyinza okwetaaga okukkirizibwa mu palamenti ne kabineti okusinziira ku bukuumi bwazo eri obukuumi bw’abantu awamu n’ensaasaanya y’olukale.
"In parliament, the draft policy is presented to the responsible Parliamentary committee for further scrutiny (such as Parliamentary Health) and it is subsequently discussed at the floor of Parliament by the members of parliament.","Mu Palamenti, ebbago ly’enkola eno lyanjulwa eri akakiiko ka Palamenti akavunaanyizibwa okwongera okwekenneenya (nga ebyobulamu bya palamenti) era oluvannyuma ne luteesebwako ku mwaliiro gwa Palamenti ababaka ba Palamenti."
"Once the Parliament approves the policy, it is forwarded to Cabinet for final approval.","Palamenti bw’emala okukkiriza enkola eno, eweerezebwa mu kabineti okusobola okukkirizibwa okusembayo."
Cabinet has three options to consider in passage of the policy;,Kabineti erina engeri ssatu z’erina okulowoozaako mu kuyisa enkola eno;
If existing policies and legislative framework are sufficient to address the issues in the policy proposals  Cabinet may decide to do nothing and therefore dismiss the policy.,Singa enkola eziriwo n’enkola y’amateeka bimala okukola ku nsonga eziri mu biteeso by’enkola kabineti eyinza okusalawo obutabaako ky’ekola n’olwekyo egoba enkola.
The Cabinet may decide that the proposals made in the policy feed into already existing policy frameworks and can be improved to cover aspects The Cabinet may maintain the status quo and instead enhance on-going implementation of the existing policies and strengthen the aspects related to the subject matter of the proposed policy and other strategies without necessarily having a new policy in The Cabinet may decide to adopt the policy and implement the proposal in the policy under a new policy framework.,Kabineti eyinza okusalawo nti ebiteeso ebikoleddwa mu nkola y’enkola mu nkola z’enkola ezaaliwo edda era bisobola okulongoosebwa okusobola okukwata ku nsonga Kabineti z’eyinza okukuuma embeera eriwo era mu kifo ky’ekyo okutumbula okussa mu nkola enkola eziriwo ezigenda mu maaso n’okunyweza ensonga ezikwata ku nsonga y’enkola eteeseddwa n’enkola endala nga tekitegeeza nti zirina enkola empya mu Kabineti eyinza okusalawo okutwala enkola eno n’okussa mu nkola ekiteeso mu nkola eri wansi w’enkola empya ey’enkola.
Lobby and influence the meeting agendas to have the draft policy discussed at the successive approvalstages.,Lobby and influence the meeting agendas okubeera n’ebbago ly’enkola eteeseddwako ku bbaluwa eziddirira ez’okukkiriza.
Prepare to submit all the supporting documents that may be required during the policy 3.5.3.,Weetegeke okuwaayo ebiwandiiko byonna ebiwagira ebiyinza okwetaagisa mu nkola 3.5.3.
"Policy Implementation Upon the approval, a public policy is implemented according to its implementation strategy.","Okussa mu nkola enkola Ku kukkirizibwa, enkola ya gavumenti eteekebwa mu nkola okusinziira ku nteekateeka yaayo ey’okussa mu nkola."
One critical aspect of policy implementation is dissemination to the general public for purposes of publicity and ensuring a high degree of conversance among the policy implementers.,Ekimu ku bintu ebikulu mu kuteeka mu nkola enkola kwe kubunyisa abantu bonna olw’ebigendererwa by’okumanyisa abantu n’okulaba ng’abassa mu nkola enkola bafuna eddaala ery’amaanyi.
"At this stage, policy decisions lead to specific actions at the level of programs and projects, policy ideas are translated into proper projects intended to achieve policy valued objectives, strategies are developed to implement these programs and projects.","Ku mutendera guno, okusalawo kw’enkola kuleeta ebikolwa ebitongole ku mutendera gwa pulogulaamu ne pulojekiti, ebirowoozo by’enkola bivvuunulwa mu pulojekiti entuufu ezigendereddwamu okutuukiriza ebigendererwa eby’omuwendo gw’enkola, enkola zikolebwa okussa mu nkola enteekateeka zino ne pulojekiti."
Public policy actions lead to defined outcomes that are tangible and measurable.,Ebikolwa by‟enkola ya gavumenti bivaako ebivaamu ebitegeerekese ebikwatibwako era ebipima.
"At this stage, policy impact begins to be visible, but also unintended consequences of public policy can be analyzed.","Ku mutendera guno, okukosa enkola kutandika okulabika, naye era n’ebiva mu nkola ya gavumenti ebitali bigenderere bisobola okwekenneenyezebwa."
Policy Monitoring and Evaluation Policy monitoring seeks to establish whether provisions and associated programs and projects are implemented so as to achieve the stated goal and objectives.,Okulondoola enkola n’okwekenneenya enkola okulondoola kunoonya okuzuula oba ebiragiro ne pulogulaamu ezikwatagana ne pulojekiti ziteekebwa mu nkola okusobola okutuukiriza ekigendererwa n’ebigendererwa ebiragiddwa.
It involves determining whether or not the observed events are consistent with the policy provisions and planned activities.,Kizingiramu okuzuula oba ebibaawo ebitunuuliddwa bikwatagana n’enteekateeka n’emirimu egitegekeddwa.
It is a checking process to correct weaknesses during the implementation.,Ye nkola y’okukebera okutereeza obunafu mu kiseera ky’okussa mu nkola.
"Policy monitoring helps to exercise provision and control and from this process, it can be identified that the policy is not going according to plan or it appears the policy is not on course to achieve its targets.","Okulondoola enkola kuyamba okukozesa okugaba n’okufuga era okuva mu nkola eno, kiyinza okuzuulibwa nti enkola eno tegenda mu maaso okusinziira ku nteekateeka oba kirabika enkola eno tegenda mu kkubo okutuukiriza ebiruubirirwa byayo."
This helps policy managers to review if implementation of strategies are achieving intended outcomes to inform appropriate modification and establish a new plan on which right actions can be taken.,Kino kiyamba abaddukanya enkola okwekenneenya singa okussa mu nkola enkola zituuka ku bigendererwa ebivaamu okumanyisa enkyukakyuka entuufu n’okuteekawo enteekateeka empya ku bikolwa ebituufu ebisobola okukolebwa.
"There are also three important issues must be considered during policy monitoring The involvement of relevant actors who are key to consult in policy Recognizing differences in attitudes, competencies, intelligence, personality during data collection.","Waliwo n’ensonga ssatu enkulu zirina okulowoozebwako mu kiseera ky’okulondoola enkola okwenyigira kw’abazannyi abakwatibwako abalina ekisumuluzo eky’okwebuuza mu nkola okutegeera enjawulo mu ndowooza, obusobozi, amagezi, omuntu mu kiseera ky’okukung’aanya ebikwata ku bantu."
It is done throughout the policy implementation Impact monitoring  this provides information on the progress of the policy implementation at given points in time.,Kikolebwa mu nkola yonna Enkola y’okussa mu nkola Enkola eno etuwa amawulire ku nkulaakulana y’okussa mu nkola enkola mu biseera ebiweereddwa.
Policy evaluation ascertains whether ornot;The intended policy goals and objectives have been achieved; The policy implementation process has been cost effective; The policy problems and the implementation strategies were identified correctly; The policy outcomes have generated other host of problems that require policy 3.7.2.,Okukebera enkola kukakasa oba oba not;ebigendererwa by’enkola n’ebigendererwa ebigendereddwa bituukiddwako; Enkola y’okussa mu nkola enkola ebadde ya ssente nnyingi; Ebizibu by‟enkola n‟enkola z‟okussa mu nkola byazuulibwa bulungi; Ebiva mu nkola bivuddemu ebizibu ebirala eby’omukiise ebyetaagisa enkola 3.7.2.
Policy evaluation Policy evaluation involves a comprehensive assessment of whether or not the policy has had any impact.,Okwekenenya enkola okwekenneenya kuzingiramu okwekenneenya okujjuvu oba enkola eno ebadde n’akakwate konna oba nedda.
The interest is to match outcomes with the objectives.,Ekintu ekifaayo kwe kukwataganya ebivaamu n‟ebigendererwa.
"If the intended Health commodities and services have been produced to the public, then the policy is said to be effective; If Health commodities and services are delivered at a minimum cost, the policy is said to be efficient and effective; and If policy outcomes are delivered at a maximum cost, then the policy is likely to be a bad one and should therefore be reformed or abandoned.","Singa ebintu n’obuweereza eby’obulamu ebigendereddwa biba bikoleddwa eri abantu bonna, olwo enkola eyo kigambibwa nti ekola bulungi; Singa ebintu by’ebyobulamu n’obuweereza biweebwa ku ssente entono, enkola eyo kigambibwa nti ekola bulungi era ekola bulungi; Era singa ebiva mu nkola bituusibwa ku ssente ezisinga obunene, olwo enkola eyolekedde okuba embi era n’olwekyo erina okulongoosebwa oba okusuulibwa."
Key issues to note in policy monitoring and evaluation Policy monitoring and evaluation are different activities with different purposes but are mutually reinforcing in the policy implementation process.,Ensonga enkulu ezirina okwetegereza mu kulondoola enkola n’okwekenneenya enkola okulondoola n’okwekenneenya emirimu mirimu gya njawulo nga girina ebigendererwa eby’enjawulo naye nga ginywezagana mu nkola y’okussa mu nkola enkola.
Policy is monitored to track its implementation progress and to establish whether or not it is on course in line with its goal and objectives.,Enkola erondoolebwa okulondoola enkulaakulana yaayo mu nkola n’okuteekawo oba eri ku kkubo erikwatagana n’ekigendererwa kyayo n’ebigendererwa byayo.
While Policy is evaluated to establish whether it has achieved its intended goal and objectives.,ate enkola yeekenneenyezebwa okuzuula oba etuuse ku kigendererwa kyayo n’ebigendererwa byayo.
"Policy monitoring is continuously conducted both formally and informally while policy evaluation is evaluated periodically and usually formal (e.g mid-term evaluation /impact monitoring, or end-line / summative evaluation).","Okulondoola enkola kukolebwa obutasalako mu butongole ne mu butongole ate okwekenneenya enkola kwekenneenyezebwa buli luvannyuma lwa kiseera era ebiseera ebisinga mu butongole (e.g okwekenneenya okw’omu makkati /Okulondoola okukosebwa, oba okwekenneenya okw’enkomerero / okufunza)."
Policy monitoring and evaluation can be conducted by a designated technical person Policy M&Especialist or any other designated technical person in the Policy development focal person).,Okulondoola enkola n’okwekenneenya kuyinza okukolebwa enkola ey’ekikugu eyalondebwa M&Especialist oba omuntu omulala yenna ow’ebyekikugu alondeddwa mu nkola y’okukulaakulanya enkola).
"Policy monitoring and evaluation data (report) is important to inform appropriate actions to be taken in the course of policy implementation as well as in the designing of new policies that are more effective, efficient, and responsive.","Okulondoola enkola n’okwekenneenya ebikwata ku nkola (lipoota) kikulu okumanyisa ebikolwa ebituufu ebirina okukolebwa mu nkola y’okussa mu nkola enkola awamu n’okukola enteekateeka empya ezisinga okukola obulungi, ezikola obulungi, era eziddamu."
"Policy review and analysis Policy review and analysis is the activity involving studying, gathering, processing, ordering and presenting specific information for policy making.","Okuddamu okwetegereza enkola n’okwekenneenya enkola y’okuddamu okwetegereza n’okwekenneenya enkola y’emirimu gy’okusoma, okukung’aanya, okukola ku nsonga, okulagira n’okwanjulira abantu amawulire ag’enjawulo okukola enkola."
Analysis is an important phase in policy making and it is essential for making critical policy decisions.,Okwekenenya mutendera mukulu mu kukola enkola era kyetaagisa okusalawo ennyo ku nkola.
Policy analysis and review helps to inform policy makers on the implications of the options presented and enables them to know whether the existing policy is in tandem with the current national and international trends or whether it is still relevant in the ever changing circumstances.,Okwekenenya enkola n’okuddamu okwetegereza biyamba okumanyisa abakola enkola ku biyinza okuva mu nkola eziragiddwa era kibasobozesa okumanya oba enkola eriwo ekwatagana n’emitendera gy’eggwanga n’ensi yonna eriwo kati oba nga kikyali kikwatagana mu mbeera ekyukakyuka buli kiseera.
"Policy evaluation, review and analyses provide sufficient data on the performance of existing policy to guide decisions and course of action regarding the policy in question.","Okwekenenya enkola, okwekenneenya n’okwekenneenya biwa ebikwata ku nkola y’enkola eriwo okulungamya okusalawo n’engeri y’okukola ku nkola eyogerwako."
This can either be making reforms in the existing policy or formulating a new policy that is more relevant to the prevailing circumstances.,Kino kiyinza okuba nga kikola ennongoosereza mu nkola eriwo oba okukola enkola empya esinga okukwatagana n’embeera ezibaddewo.
Key issues to note in policy analysis and review Policy analysis and review is a deliberate and targeted activity towards a certain existing policy.,Ensonga enkulu ezirina okwetegereza mu kwekenneenya enkola n’okuddamu okwetegereza enkola n’okuddamu okwetegereza enkola y’emirimu mu bugenderevu era egenderere eri enkola ezimu eziriwo.
It is informed by data generated during monitoring and Policy analysis and review is a continuous activity in the policy cycle.,Kitegeezebwa data ekolebwa mu kiseera ky’okulondoola n’okwekenneenya enkola n’okuddamu okwetegereza mulimu ogugenda mu maaso mu nkola y’enkola.
"However, as a targeted activity, it is conducted towards the end of the life of the policy or even after the implementation period.","Naye, ng’omulimu ogugendereddwamu, gukolebwa nga enkola y’enkola eno egenda okuggwaako oba wadde ng’ekiseera ky’okussa mu nkola kiwedde."
Policy analysis and review is done in response to the emerging issues from monitoring and evaluation but importantly to respond to the current national and international trends.,Okwekenenya enkola n’okuddamu okwetegereza kukolebwa nga ayanukula ensonga ezigenda okuvaayo okuva mu kulondoola n’okwekenneenya naye ekikulu okuddamu emitendera gy’eggwanga n’ensi yonna eriwo kati.
Policy review and analysis can be conducted by a designated technical person Policy review and analysis specialist in the Policy Analysis designated technical person in the Policy review and analysis leads to the reforming of the existing policy or formulating 	 a new policy that is more relevant and responsive to the prevailing circumstances.,Okuddamu okwetegereza n’okwekenneenya enkola kuyinza okukolebwa omukugu mu kwekenneenya enkola y’ebyekikugu n’okwekenneenya mu kwekenneenya enkola eyalondebwa mu kwekenneenya n’okwekenneenya enkola kiviirako okutereeza enkola eriwo oba okukola enkola empya esinga okukwatagana era ekwatagana n’embeera ezibaddewo.
"In performing the task of supply chain policy analysis and review, the designated technical personnel who can critically analyze and review health policies on a continuous process.","Mu kukola omulimu gw’okwekenneenya enkola y’okugaba n’okuddamu okwetegereza, abakozi ab’ekikugu abaalondebwa abasobola okwekenneenya ennyo n’okwekenneenya enkola z’ebyobulamu ku nkola etakoma."

Published and anecdotal data indicate that between 60-74% of admitted patients are on one or more systemic antibiotics.,Ebiwandiiko ebifulumiziddwa n’eby’olugero biraga nti wakati w’ebitundu 60-74% ku balwadde abaweebwa ebitanda bali ku ddagala limu oba eziwera ez’omubiri.
The adherence to the national treatment guidelines and use of microbiology test results is low.,Okunywerera ku ndagiriro y’obujjanjabi mu ggwanga n’okukozesa ebyava mu kukebera obuwuka obutonotono (microbiology test results) mutono.
"However, the system to manage and support community health workers has not been well established leading to fragmented geographic coverage, inconsistent functionality, and intermittent assistance from external partners.","Naye, enkola y’okuddukanya n’okuwagira abakozi b’ebyobulamu mu kitundu tebadde bulungi kivaako okubunyisa ebitundu ebikutusekutuse, emirimu egitakwatagana, n’obuyambi obutasalako okuva mu bakolagana ab’ebweru."
There is documented evidence that patients will use antibiotics before a doctor .,Waliwo obujulizi obuwandiikiddwa nti abalwadde bajja kukozesa eddagala eritta obuwuka mu maaso g'omusawo .
"This self-medicated use of antibiotics is enabled by the ease of access to these medicines in drug shops and pharmacies despite the prevailing law  requiring a prescription from a Recognizing the importance of community health and the need to address its related challenges, the period of 2021/22-2025/26.","Okukozesa kuno okw’eddagala eritta obuwuka mu ngeri ey’obujjanjabi kusobozeseddwa okwanguyiza okufuna eddagala lino mu maduuka g’eddagala n’amaduuka g’eddagala wadde ng’etteeka erifuga erwetaaga okuwandiikibwa okuva mu kumanya obukulu bw’obulamu bw’ekitundu n’obwetaavu bw’okukola ku kusoomoozebwa kwabwo okukwatagana, ekiseera kya 2021/22-2025/26."
This strategy is anchored in the Parish Development Model as well as other national frameworks.,Enkola eno esimbiddwa mu nkola y’okukulaakulanya ekigo nga kwotadde n’enkola endala ez’eggwanga.
It is also intended to ensure that health services are accessible and that a person-centered approach in the provision of healthcare is implemented to achieve significant impact in the short and long term.,Era kigendereddwamu okulaba ng’obuweereza bw’ebyobulamu bufunibwa era nti enkola eyesigamiziddwa ku muntu mu kuwa obujjanjabi eteekebwa mu nkola okusobola okutuuka ku buzibu obw’amaanyi mu bbanga ettono n’ery’ewala.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Good infection prevention and control (IPC) is proposed as a key intervention against the spread of resistant pathogens within the facility and limits the use/exposure to antibiotics.,National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Good Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) eteesebwako ng’ekikulu ekiyingira mu nsonga ku kusaasaana kw’obuwuka obuziyiza endwadde mu kifo kino era kissa ekkomo ku nkozesa/okulaga eddagala eritta obuwuka.
Evidence has shown that effective hand hygiene practices reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) by 50% while effective infection prevention and control reduce healthcareassociated infections by at least 30% (WHO).,Obujulizi bulaze nti enkola ennungamu ey’obuyonjo mu ngalo zikendeeza ku bulwadde obukwatagana n’ebyobulamu (HCAI) ebitundu 50% ate okuziyiza okulungi n’okuziyiza obulwadde bukendeeza ku ndwadde ezikwatagana n’ebyobulamu waakiri 30% (WHO).
"However, compliance with this practice among healthcare workers is low.",Wabula okugoberera enkola eno mu bakozi b’ebyobulamu ntono.
"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the commonest cause of HAIs, has been isolated from the hands of more than half of healthcare workers.","Ekirungo kya Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ekiziyiza methicillin (MRSA), ekisinga okuvaako HAIs, kibadde kyawuddwamu okuva mu mikono gy’abakozi b’ebyobulamu abasukka mu kitundu."
Hand hygiene may help in the control of nosocomial infections .,Obuyonjo mu ngalo buyinza okuyamba mu kufuga endwadde z'omu nnyindo .
"In line with the NAP documented approaches for implementing AMS programs nationwide, it is crucial to emphasize increasing capacity for surveillance of resistant bacteria and monitoring volumes of antibiotics consumed alongside conducting awareness campaigns among health workers (Dr Adrian JBrink et al., 2016, Mera A. Ababneh et al., 2021).","Mu kukwatagana n’enkola eziwandiikiddwa mu NAP ez’okussa mu nkola enteekateeka za AMS mu ggwanga lyonna, kikulu nnyo okuggumiza okwongera ku busobozi bw’okulondoola obuwuka obuziyiza n’okulondoola obungi bw’eddagala eritta obuwuka erikolebwa wamu n’okukola kampeyini z’okumanyisa abantu mu bakozi b’ebyobulamu (Dr Adrian Jbrink et al., 2016, Mera A.

Accurate and representative AMR surveillance data to inform treatment guidelines and AMR control strategies 3.4 Developing an Antibiogram An antibiogram is an aggregated profile of antimicrobial susceptibility testing data of a specific microorganism to a set of antimicrobials.,Ebikwata ku kulondoola AMR ebituufu era ebikiikirira okumanyisa ebiragiro by’obujjanjabi n’enkola z’okufuga AMR 3.4 Okukola eddagala eritta obuwuka Eddagala eritta obuwuka (antibiogram).
The antibiogram is an essential resource for facilities to track changes in antimicrobial resistance and to guide empirical antimicrobial treatment.,Antibiogram kye kintu ekikulu eky’okukozesa mu bifo okulondoola enkyukakyuka mu buziyiza obuziyiza obuwuka n’okulungamya eddagala eritta obuwuka erikolebwa mu ngeri ey’okugezesa.
Antibiograms can also be used to perform surveillance for the emergence of drug-resistant organisms and identify areas for intervention by antimicrobial stewardship programs and training needs.,Eddagala eritta obuwuka era liyinza okukozesebwa okukola okulondoola okuvaayo kw’ebiramu ebiziyiza eddagala n’okuzuula ebifo eby’okuyingira mu nsonga nga biyita mu nteekateeka z’okulabirira obuwuka n’ebyetaago by’okutendekebwa.
An antibiogram is developed from specific information about the facilitys microbiology cultures.,Antibiogram ekolebwa okuva mu mawulire ag’enjawulo agakwata ku bifo eby’obuwangwa obutono (microbiology cultures).
You can potentially obtain these data from several different sources.,Osobola okufuna data zino okuva mu nsonda ez’enjawulo eziwerako.
What data are needed to create the antibiogram?,Data ki eyeetaagibwa okukola eddagala eritta obuwuka?
"The antibiogram should enable the categorization of patient characteristics, thereby providing completeness of laboratory/microbiology data collection tools is critical.","Eddagala eritta obuwuka lirina okusobozesa okugabanya mu bika by’engeri z’omulwadde, bwe kityo ne kiwa obujjuvu bw’ebikozesebwa mu kukungaanya ebikwata ku laboratory/microbiology kikulu nnyo."

Health facility antibiograms should be reviewed annually.,Eddagala eriweweeza ku biramu ery’ekifo ky’ebyobulamu lirina okwekenneenyezebwa buli mwaka.
Antibiotic susceptibility data should include the,Data y’okukwatibwa eddagala eritta obuwuka erina okubeeramu
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Number of pathogens identified Proportion of pathogens that are susceptible to each tested drug The antibiogram should only include pathogen species for which there are 30 or more isolates.,National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Omuwendo gw’obuwuka obuleeta endwadde oguzuuliddwa ekitundu ky’obuwuka obuleeta endwadde ekiyinza okukwatibwa buli ddagala erikebereddwa eddagala eritta obuwuka lirina okubeeramu ebika by’obuwuka obuleeta endwadde bwokka nga waliwo ebitundu 30 oba okusingawo ebyawuliddwa.
"If the data available includes organisms with fewer than 30 isolates, you should determine if it is essential to include the species.","Singa data eriwo erimu ebiramu ebirina ebitundu ebitakka wansi wa 30 ebyawuliddwa, olina okuzuula oba kyetaagisa okussaamu ebika."
"If they are, you should include a note to indicate less statistical validity of the estimates of percentage susceptibility (%S).","Bwe baba, olina okussaamu akawandiiko akalaga obutuufu bw’ebibalo obutono obw’okubalirira kw’ebitundu ku kikumi eby’okukwatibwa (%s)."
The factors that can affect cumulative antibiogram data include: Patient population served.,Ensonga eziyinza okukosa ebikwata ku ddagala eritta obuwuka obuyitibwa cumulative antibiogram mulimu: omuwendo gw’abalwadde abaweebwa.
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - The first column lists the organisms that were included; these may be separated by Grampositive and Gram-negative results.,National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Omuko ogusooka gulaga ebiramu ebyalimu; Bino biyinza okwawulwamu ebivudde mu grampositive ne gram-negative.
"The remaining columns of the antibiogram are the antibiotics that were tested, and the organisms susceptibilities are presented as a percentage of the total number of isolates.","Empagi ezisigadde ez’eddagala eritta obuwuka (antibiogram) ze ddagala eritta obuwuka eryakeberebwa, era ebiramu ebiyinza okukwatibwa biragiddwa ng’ebitundu ku kikumi eby’omuwendo gwonna ogw’ebitundu ebyawuliddwa."
A patient may be cultured multiple times in a year and their results consistently reveal Staphylococcus aureus.,Omulwadde ayinza okukuza emirundi mingi mu mwaka era ebivuddemu bye bitegeeza bulijjo Staphylococcus aureus.
The antibiogram should only be used as a general guide for empirical antimicrobial therapy until the specific antimicrobial susceptibility test results for a particular patient become available.,Eddagala eritta obuwuka lirina kukozesebwa ng’omulagirizi ow’awamu ow’obujjanjabi obulwanyisa obuwuka obuyitibwa empirical antimicrobial therapy okutuusa ng’ebyava mu kukebera obulwadde obw’enjawulo obw’okuziyiza obuwuka eri omulwadde yennyini bifuuse.
"A patients particular infection history, including past antimicrobial use, must also be A cumulative antibiogram may provide the basis for selection of empirical antimicrobial treatments for specific infections before the patients antimicrobial susceptibility results become available.","A patients particular infection history, omuli okukozesa eddagala eritta obuwuka emabega, era erina okuba eddagala eritta obuwuka erikuŋŋaanyiziddwa liyinza okuwa omusingi gw’okulonda eddagala eritta obuwuka erikwata ku bulwadde obw’enjawulo ng’abalwadde tebannaba kufuuka balwadde."
"If you have a small number of cultures represented in your antibiogram, updating your antibiogram once a year may be sufficient.","Bw’oba olina obuwangwa obutono obukiikirirwa mu ddagala lyo eritta obuwuka, ng’ozza eddagala lyo ku mulembe omulundi gumu mu mwaka kiyinza okumala."
Peripheral Health facilities not performing culture and sensitivity should use the sample referral system for obtaining such tests to be able obtain AMR surveillance data for their facilities.,Peripheral Health Facilities Ebitakola Culture ne Sensitivity birina okukozesa enkola ya sample referral system okufuna ebigezo nga bino okusobola okufuna AMR okulondoola data for their facilities.
The chair for the facility AMS subcommittee is responsible for ensuring the availability and access to the facility antibiogram.,Ssentebe w’akakiiko ka AMS akakola ku kifo kino y’evunaanyizibwa okulaba ng’eddagala eriweebwa mu kifo kino libeerawo n’okutuuka ku kifo kino.
The different metrics of measuring consumption as well as assessing use are also described.,Ebipimo eby’enjawulo eby’okupima enkozesa nga kwotadde n’okukebera enkozesa nabyo binnyonnyolwa.
Irrational use of Antimicrobials is a modifiable risk factor for antimicrobial resistance.,Okukozesa eddagala eritta obuwuka mu ngeri etategeerekeka (Irrational use of antimicrobials) kintu kya bulabe ekiyinza okukyusibwakyusibwa okuziyiza obuwuka obuleeta obulwadde.
Optimal use of antimicrobials is important at all levels of care within the country and will go a long way in addressing the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.,Okukozesa obulungi eddagala eritta obuwuka kikulu ku mitendera gyonna egy’okulabirira munda mu ggwanga era kijja kugenda wala mu kukola ku kujja kw’obuziyiza obulwanyisa obuwuka.
AMCU data can be used to provide baseline information to evaluate AMS interventions.,Data ya AMCU esobola okukozesebwa okuwa amawulire agasookerwako okwekenneenya enkola za AMS.

"One of the key assumptions for AMC data is that all that is imported is consumed locally and all that is distributed, sold, or issued from health facility stores is consumed; thus, it serves as a proxy estimate of the use of antimicrobials.","Ekimu ku bikulu ebiteeberezebwa ku bikwata ku bikwata ku AMC kwe kuba nti byonna ebiyingizibwa mu ggwanga bikozesebwa mu kitundu era byonna ebigabanyizibwa, ebitundibwa, oba ebifulumizibwa okuva mu maduuka g’ebifo by’ebyobulamu bikozesebwa; Bwe kityo, kikola ng’okubalirira okukiikirira enkozesa y’eddagala eritta obuwuka."
National/Centralized distributors Centralized level warehouse distribution records can also provide aggregated data of antimicrobial consumption that act as a proxy for use to the health facilities or institutions that they serve.,Ebiwandiiko by’abagaba ebintu mu ggwanga/eby’omu makkati Ebiwandiiko by’okugabanya sitoowa eby’omutendera ogw’omu makkati nabyo bisobola okuwa ebikwata ku kukozesa eddagala eritta obuwuka ebikola ng’ekiikirira okukozesebwa mu bifo by’ebyobulamu oba ebitongole bye biweereza.
"The consumption can be disaggregated or stratified by region/geographical location, by health facility level of care, by public or private sectors, and again by population-level metrics using the population estimates of the regions supplied.","Enkozesa esobola okugabanyizibwamu oba okusengekebwa okusinziira ku kitundu/ekifo eky’ensi, okusinziira ku mutendera gw’okulabirira ekifo ky’ebyobulamu, ebitongole bya gavumenti oba eby’obwannannyini, era nate okusinziira ku bipimo by’omutendera gw’abantu nga tukozesa okubalirira kw’abantu ku bitundu ebiweereddwa."
Data collection at the national level is done annually by collaboration between the NDA and the portal.,Okukung’aanya amawulire ku mutendera gw’eggwanga kukolebwa buli mwaka nga bakolagana wakati wa NDA n’omukutu.
The data collection methodology is based on the WHO GLASS Manual on management of Antimicrobial consumption data .,Enkola y'okukung'aanya ebikwata ku bantu yeesigamiziddwa ku kitabo kya WHO ekya WHO ku kuddukanya amawulire agakwata ku nkozesa y'eddagala eritta obuwuka .
"The data may be aggregated at the store level to represent the total consumption for the facility, or disaggregated by antimicrobial The data collection method is based on the WHO Methodology for AMC surveillance in (version 2019).","Ebiwandiiko biyinza okugatta ku mutendera gwa sitoowa okukiikirira omuwendo gwonna ogw’okukozesa ekifo, oba okugabanyizibwamu n’eddagala eritta obuwuka Enkola y’okukung’aanya amawulire yeesigamiziddwa ku nkola ya WHO ey’okulondoola AMC mu (Version 2019)."
"It uses the ATC/DDD methodology to calculate consumption, and an MS. Excel template is available and instructions for filling it are provided in WHO guidance on surveillance of antimicrobial consumption in 4.1.3 Reporting metrics for AMC data Antimicrobial consumption is measured using aggregate data of all antimicrobials consumed in a given period using a common system of nomenclature and standardized methodology.","Ekozesa enkola ya ATC/DDD okubala enkozesa, ne MS. Excel Template eriwo era ebiragiro by’okukijjuza biweereddwa mu WHO obulagirizi ku kulondoola okukozesa eddagala eritta obuwuka mu 4.1.3 Reporting Metrics for AMC data antimicrobial consumption epimibwa nga tukozesa data aggregate of all antimicrobials consured in a given period using a common system of nomenclature and standardized methodology."
"The most commonly used system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, and the most commonly used measurement metric is the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs).",Enkola esinga okukozesebwa ye nkola y’okugabanya eddagala erijjanjaba obulwadde (ATC) era esinga okukozesebwa mu kupima gwe muwendo gwa dose ezitegeerekese buli lunaku (DDDs).
DDDs are assigned to different antibiotics based on their pharmacological properties and recommended daily dosages.,DDDs ziweebwa eddagala ery’enjawulo eritta obuwuka okusinziira ku ddagala lyazo era ne lisemba okuweebwa eddagala lya buli lunaku.
"This may relate to programs such as HIV, TB, and malaria or to special populations such as migrants and refugees.","Kino kiyinza okukwatagana ne pulogulaamu nga siriimu, akafuba, n’omusujja gw’ensiri oba ku bantu ab’enjawulo ng’ababundabunda n’ababundabunda."
"For example 10 DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day can be interpreted as a representative group of 1000 inhabitants, 10 DDDs of the drug are utilized on average, on any given day of the year analysed.","Okugeza 10 DDDs ku buli bantu 1000 buli lunaku zisobola okutaputibwa ng’ekibinja ekikiikiridde abantu 1000, DDD 10 ez’eddagala zikozesebwa ku kigero, ku lunaku lwonna olumu mu mwaka okwekenneenya."
"Alternatively, this can be expressed as 10/1000 (1%) of the population are receiving this drug each day in that year.","Ekirala, kino kiyinza okulagibwa nga 10/1000 (1%) ku bantu bafuna eddagala lino buli lunaku mu mwaka ogwo."
This estimate is most useful for drugs used chronically and when there is good agreement between the average prescribed daily dose (PDD) and the DDD.,Okubalirira kuno kusinga kuba kwa mugaso eri eddagala erikozesebwa mu ngeri ey’olubeerera era bwe wabaawo okukkaanya okulungi wakati wa ddoozi eya bulijjo elagirwa buli lunaku (PDD) ne DDD.
"It estimates the facility's antimicrobial consumption by patient load It is calculated by dividing the total number of DDDs consumed over a given period by the number of bed days in the same period, multiplied by 100.","Ebalirira nti ekifo kino ekirwanyisa obuwuka nga kiyita mu mugugu gw’omulwadde Kibalwa nga kigabanya omuwendo gwonna ogwa DDDs ezikozesebwa mu kiseera ekigere n’omuwendo gw’ennaku z’ekitanda mu kiseera kye kimu, nga zikubisibwamu 100."
The number of bed days refers to the total number of days that beds in a healthcare facility are occupied by patients during a specific time frame.,Omuwendo gw’ennaku z’oku kitanda gutegeeza omuwendo gwonna ogw’ennaku ebitanda mu kifo eky’ebyobulamu abalwadde mwe bibeera mu kiseera ekigere.
"To calculate DDDs per patient, the total number of DDDs consumed within a defined period is divided by the total number of individual patients who received antibiotics during the same period.","Okubala DDDs buli mulwadde, omuwendo gwonna ogwa DDDs ezikozesebwa mu kiseera ekigere gugabanyizibwamu omuwendo gwonna ogw’abalwadde ssekinnoomu abafuna eddagala eritta obuwuka mu kiseera kye kimu."
"By comparing DDDs per patient over time or across different settings, healthcare providers can identify patterns, trends, or deviations from established guidelines.","Nga bageraageranya DDDs buli mulwadde mu kiseera oba mu bifo eby‟enjawulo, abajjanjabi basobola okuzuula enkola, emitendera, oba okukyama okuva ku ndagiriro eziteereddwawo."
Antibiotic use (AMU) is derived from individual patient data and may include information on patient characteristics and indications for treatment.,Enkozesa y’eddagala eritta obuwuka (AMU) eggibwa mu bikwata ku balwadde ssekinnoomu era eyinza okubeeramu amawulire agakwata ku mpisa z’omulwadde n’ebiraga obujjanjabi.
Measurement of antimicrobial use at facility and community levels is critical to understanding the prevailing trends of antimicrobial use and providing context to the emergence of AMR.,Okupima enkozesa y’obuwuka ku mutendera gw’ekifo n’ekitundu kikulu nnyo okutegeera emitendera egy’okukozesa eddagala eritta obuwuka n’okuwa embeera eri okuvaayo kwa AMR.

Success of educational interventions depends on how the information is presented.,Obuwanguzi bw‟okuyingira mu nsonga z‟ebyenjigiriza businziira ku ngeri amawulire gye galagibwamu.
Visual and audio aids (posters/power point presentations) can be useful.,Ebintu ebirabika n’amaloboozi (posters/power point presentations) bisobola okuba eby’omugaso.

The concept of facility catchment area (F-CAPA) is derived from the hub and spoke model where the facility in question is the primary health care facility.,Endowooza y’ekifo ekikung’aanyizibwamu amazzi (F-CAPA) eggibwa mu nkola ya hub ne spoke nga ekifo ekyogerwako kye kifo ekisookerwako eky’ebyobulamu.
The facility has all technical human resources trained to manage PHC interventions.,Ekifo kino kirina abakozi bonna ab’ekikugu abatendekeddwa okuddukanya okuyingira mu nsonga za PHC.
The CHEWS who are based at the parishes served by this facility are all attached to the facility and so are the VHTS.,Abakamula abasinziira ku bigo ebiweebwa ekifo kino bonna beegasse ku kifo kino era ne VHTs bwe zityo.
"A catchment area: means the population, for which a health facility has responsibility.","Ekifo ekikuŋŋaanyizibwamu amazzi: kitegeeza omuwendo gw’abantu, ekifo ky’ebyobulamu kye kirina obuvunaanyizibwa."
"The sequencing of the facility catchment area planning process in this guide is designed to fit within this period, operating in annual and three-month cycles.","Okulonda ensengeka y’enteekateeka y’ekifo ekikwata amazzi mu kitabo kino ekoleddwa okutuukagana mu kiseera kino, ng’ekola mu mitendera egy’omwezi n’esatu."
The community health plan is a component of the health facility plan guided by the Mo.,Enteekateeka y‟ebyobulamu mu bantu kitundu kya nteekateeka y‟ekifo ky‟ebyobulamu ekulemberwa MO.
"H planning guidelines, which is subsequently incorporated within the sub-county local government development plan.","h Enkola y’okuteekateeka, oluvannyuma eyingizibwa mu nteekateeka ya gavumenti ey’ebitundu entono ey’enkulaakulana."
The facility should also map all Community Health assets (including the Community Health Workers using the Community Health workers Registry) and stakeholders.,Ekifo kino era kisaana okukola maapu y’ebintu byonna eby’obulamu bw’abantu (nga mw’otwalidde n’abakozi b’ebyobulamu mu kitundu nga bakozesa ekiwandiiko ky’abakozi b’ebyobulamu mu kitundu) n’abakwatibwako.
Prioritization should include: Aggregation of village and parish action plans Consideration of community barriers or challenges Identify and rank the problems according to their scores from the facility catchment area health assessment.,Okukulembeza kulina okubeeramu: Okugatta enteekateeka z‟okukola ku byalo n‟ekigo Okulowooza ku biziyiza oba okusoomoozebwa kw‟ekitundu okuzuula n‟okuteeka ebizibu okusinziira ku bubonero bwabwe okuva mu kifo eky‟okukwatamu abantu mu kifo ekikwata ebifo.

"Where a spring box needs cleaning or maintenance work, standard operating procedures should be followed to ensure contaminants are not introduced into the spring during the work.","Spring box bwe yeetaaga omulimu gw’okuyonja oba okuddaabiriza, emitendera egy’okukola egy’omutindo girina okugobererwa okukakasa nti obucaafu tebuyingizibwa mu nsulo mu kiseera ky’omulimu."
The following aspects have to be checked during regular visits to the catchment area (,Ebintu bino wammanga birina okukeberebwa mu kiseera ky’okukyalira ekifo ekikuumirwamu amazzi buli kiseera ( .
Ensure the outlet is clean and functioning.,Kakasa nti ekifo ekifuluma kiyonjo era nga kikola.
Check the fence or barrier is in good condition.,Kebera olukomera oba ekiziyiza kiri mu mbeera nnungi.
"Where present, ensure the spring box inspection port lid is in place, locked and in Where present, ensure the spring box air vent and overflow pipe is in place and in good condition.","Awabeera, kakasa nti ekibikka ku mwalo gw’okukebera mu spring box kiri mu kifo, nga kikubiddwako kkufulu era nga kiri we kiri, kakasa nti payipu y’empewo ey’empewo ey’omu ssanduuko ya spring ne payipu ekulukuta biri mu kifo era nga biri mu mbeera nnungi."
Ensure protective vermin-proof screens are in good condition.,Kakasa nti screens ezikuuma ebiwuka zibeera mu mbeera nnungi.
"Where a spring box is present, check the sediment levels.","Awali ekibokisi kya spring, kebera ku muwendo gw’ensenke."
The following steps are involved in the construction of boreholes: Before borehole drilling there is need to conduct a Hydro-geological Survey in the proposed site.,Emitendera gino gikwatibwako mu kuzimba ebinnya: nga tebannaba kusima binnya waliwo obwetaavu bw’okukola okunoonyereza ku by’amazzi mu kifo ekiteeseddwa.
This ensures the best spot is selected according to the geological data.,Kino kikakasa nti ekifo ekisinga obulungi kisunsulwa okusinziira ku bikwata ku ttaka.
"The hydro-geological data, maps, graphs and cross-section profiles obtained from the hydro-geological survey are used in determination of important information such as estimation of drilling depth and Identification of stress areas.","Ebiwandiiko ebikwata ku mazzi, maapu, giraafu n’ebifaananyi eby’okusalako ebifunibwa okuva mu kunoonyereza ku by’amazzi (hydro-geological survey) bikozesebwa mu kuzuula amawulire amakulu ng’okubalirira obuziba bw’okusima n’okuzuula ebifo ebirimu situleesi."
"Another aspect of borehole siting that demands careful consideration in populated areas is the potential for contamination by livestock and pit latrines or other waste disposal The choice of drilling method will depend on the location of the health facility and geological formations of the area such as the type of terrain, nature of aquifer and financial implications.","Ensonga endala ey’okuteeka ebinnya ebisaba okulowoozebwako n’obwegendereza mu bitundu ebirimu abantu abangi kwe kusobola okufuula obucaafu obuva mu bulunzi n’ebinnya oba okusuula kasasiro okulala Okulonda enkola y’okusima kijja kusinziira ku kifo ekifo ky’ebyobulamu n’ebitonde by’ettaka eby’ekitundu ng’ekika ky’ettaka, obutonde bw’amazzi n’ebikwata ku by’ensimbi."
"Developing a well is the process of removing fine soil particles, drill cuttings, and residual drilling mud from the well screen and borehole annulus in order to establish a good hydraulic connection with the surrounding formation.","Okukulaakulanya oluzzi y’enkola y’okuggya obutundutundu bw’ettaka obutonotono, okusima ebikoola, n’ebitooke ebisima ebitooke okuva mu ssirini y’oluzzi n’okusibira mu kinnya okusobola okuteekawo akakwate akalungi ak’amazzi n’okutondebwa okwetoolodde."
"Development also encourages a gravel filter pack to settle properly, eliminating voids, which may necessitate topping up the gravel pack a little.","Enkulaakulana era ekubiriza ekyuma ekisengejja amayinja okusenga obulungi, okumalawo ebituli, ekiyinza okwetaagisa okussaako katono ku jjinja."
"Sanitary seal - With borehole cleaning completed, the final job is the construction of a sanitary seal, which, as the name suggests, seals the borehole from surface contamination.","Sanitary Seal - Nga okuyonja ebinnya biwedde, omulimu ogusembayo kwe kuzimba ekiziyiza eky’obuyonjo, nga erinnya bwe liraga, okusiba ekinnya okuva ku bucaafu obw’okungulu."
"This should also be the responsibility of the drilling contractor, and written into the work.","Kino era kirina okuba obuvunaanyizibwa bw’omukozi w’okusima, era nga kiwandiikiddwa mu mulimu."
At least the uppermost two meters or so of annular space (probably that section formerly protected by the conductor pipe during drilling) should be cleaned out and dug into a fresh larger hole perhaps square in shape  surrounding the permanent casing.,Waakiri mita bbiri ezisinga waggulu oba bwe zityo ez’ekifo eky’enkulungo (oyinza okuba ng’ekitundu ekyali kikuumibwa payipu ya kondakita nga kisima) kisaana okuyonjebwa ne kisimibwa mu kinnya ekinene ekibisi mpozzi square mu kifaananyi ekyetoolodde ekisenge eky’olubeerera.
"Then the top of the casing must be sealed with a locked cap or welded plate, on which the borehole identification number may Pumps and test pumping - After drilling has been completed and the sanitary seal put in place, borehole test pumping is carried out.","Olwo waggulu w’ekisenge kulina okusiba n’akakookolo akasibiddwa oba pulati eya welded, nga ku yo ennamba y’ekinnya eyinza okupampagira n’okugezesa okupampagira - oluvannyuma lw’okusima okuggwa era ekisiba eky’obuyonjo ne kiteekebwa mu kifo, okupampagira ebinnya by’ebinnya kukolebwa."
"It has the following objectives: To measure the performance of the borehole To determine the efficiency of the borehole, or variation of its performance under different rates of discharge To quantify aquifer characteristics, such as transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, and Checking verticality - After the testing equipment has been removed, a check of borehole verticality (plumbness) and alignment (straightness) should be conducted.","Kirina ebigendererwa bino wammanga: okupima omulimu gw’ekinnya okuzuula obulungi bw’ekinnya, oba enkyukakyuka y’omulimu gwakyo wansi w’emiwendo egy’enjawulo egy’okufulumya okusobola okugera obungi bw’ebintu eby’omu ttaka, gamba ng’okutambuliza, obutambuzi bw’amazzi, n’okukebera okwesimbye - oluvannyuma lw’ebyuma ebigezesebwa okuggyibwawo, okukebera okw’ekizimba (obutundutundu) n’okuziyiza (okuziyiza) kulina okuba nga kulina okukeberebwa."
"This is usually done by inserting and lowering into the hole a perfectly straight, 12-metre-long steel rod or pipe, the external diameter of which should be a maximum of 13 mm (about 0.5 inch) less than the inner diameter of the main or longest section of casing.","Kino kitera okukolebwa nga oyingiza n’okukka mu kinnya ekituli oba payipu egoloddwa obulungi, obuwanvu bwa mita 12, obuwanvu bwayo obw’ebweru bulina okuba nga busukka mu mm 13 (nga yinsi 0.5) obutono okusinga obuwanvu obw’omunda obw’ekitundu ekikulu oba ekiwanvu eky’ekiyumba."
"Disinfection - Finally, assuming that it has passed the tests above, the borehole should be thoroughly disinfected with a chlorine-rich solution, such as HTH (High-test Hypochlorite), leaving a concentration of residual chlorine of 50 milligrams/litre for at least four hours.","Okutta obuwuka - Ekisembayo, nga tufudde nti kiyise mu kukebera waggulu, ekinnya kisaana okutta obulungi eddagala eririmu chlorine, nga HTH (high-test hypochlorite), okuleka ekirungo kya chlorine ekisigadde ekya miligiraamu 50/liita okumala waakiri essaawa nnya."
The borehole may then be re-sealed with the locked cap or welded plate.,Olwo ekinnya kiyinza okuddamu okusibirwa n’enkoofiira esibiddwa oba ebbakuli eya welded.
"Continuous monitoring of borehole performance can be cost-effective, helping to detect any problems before they become serious.","Okulondoola emirimu gy’ekinnya obutasalako kiyinza okukuyamba okukendeeza ku ssente, okuyamba okuzuula ebizibu byonna nga tebinnaba kufuuka bya maanyi."
"Maintenance programs should consist of regular field visits, water sampling (for chemical/microbial analyses), water level measurements, and routine monitoring by simple step-drawdown tests.","Enteekateeka z’okuddaabiriza zirina okubeera n’okukyalira ennimiro buli kiseera, okutwala sampuli z’amazzi (ku kwekenneenya eddagala/obuwuka), okupima omutindo gw’amazzi, n’okulondoola okwa bulijjo nga tuyita mu kugezesebwa okwangu okuddibwamu mu ddaala."
The data collected can be compared with those obtained when the well was new or last monitored.,Ebikwata ku bantu ebikunganyiziddwa bisobola okugeraageranyizibwa ku ebyo ebifunibwa ng’oluzzi luli lupya oba nga lwasembayo okulondoolebwa.
"A regular testing schedule consisting of a basic step-drawdown test every year is sufficient, with maintenance carried out if there is any It is prudent to erect a lockable fence around the borehole to prevent tampering and accidental along with causes and suggested remedial actions.","Enteekateeka y’okugezesa eya bulijjo erimu okugezesebwa okusookerwako mu kukuba eddaala buli mwaka emala, ng’okuddaabiriza kukolebwa singa wabaawo ekintu kyonna eky’amagezi okuzimba olukomera oluyinza okusibirwa okwetooloola ekinnya okutangira okukyusakyusa n’okugwa mu butanwa wamu n’ebivaako n’ebikolwa ebiteeseddwa okutereeza."
"Lower pump inlet Deepen borehole Drill Check/compare earlier test pumping data Reduce pumping rate Rehabilitate: Inspect screens, surge-develop to clean screens Analyze water; if hazardous, shut down borehole production and reassess Analyze water.","Lower pump inleten deepen borehole drill check/geraageranya okugezesa okwasooka data Okupampagira Okukendeeza ku pumping rate Rehabilitate: Kebera screens, surge-develop okuyonja screens okwekenneenya amazzi; Bw’oba wa bulabe, ggalawo okukola ebinnya era oddamu okwekenneenya amazzi."
The location should be carefully selected to ensure good potential for most of the year.,Ekifo kisaana okulondebwa n’obwegendereza okukakasa nti omwaka ogusinga gusobola bulungi.
"The location selected should not be prone to flooding and pollution, especially by storm water from built up areas within the upper reaches of the micro-catchment.",Ekifo ekirondeddwa tekisaanye kuba nga kitera okubooga n’obucaafu naddala amazzi g’enkuba okuva mu bitundu ebizimbibwa mu bitundu ebya waggulu eby’okukwata okutonotono.
Cut off drains should be constructed if this is feared.,Emidumu egy’okusalako girina okuzimbibwa singa kino kitya.
No pit latrine or septic tank should be constructed upstream of the dug well.,Tewali kaabuyonjo ya binnya oba ttanka ya septic erina kuzimbibwa waggulu w’omugga ogusimiddwa.
"To ensure long term good water quality and quantity, it is essential to tackle the pollution problem through sensitization of the community.","Okukakasa nti omutindo gw’amazzi amalungi mu bbanga eggwanvu, kyetaagisa okukola ku kizibu ky’obucaafu nga tuyita mu kumanyisa abantu b’omukitundu."
"The diameter of a dug well should be at least 1.2m, to allow two people to work together during the digging exercise.","Dyaamu y’oluzzi olusimiddwa erina okuba nga waakiri 1.2m, okusobozesa abantu babiri okukolera awamu mu kiseera ky’okukola dduyiro w’okusima."
A slight smaller diameter may be used if the digging is to be done by one person only.,Dyaamu entono entono eyinza okukozesebwa singa okusima kuba kukolebwa muntu omu yekka.
The well should be at least 3m below the expected lowest water level.,Oluzzi lulina okuba nga waakiri mita 3 wansi w’amazzi agasinga wansi agasuubirwa.
"Generally, the easiest and safest method of sinking a dug well is to excavate from inside of the precast concrete rings.","Okutwalira awamu, enkola ennyangu era esinga obukuumi ey’okubbira oluzzi olusimiddwa kwe kusima okuva munda mu mpeta za seminti ezikoleddwa nga tezinnabaawo."
"In very loose soil, other methods such as hand drilling (augering) should be employed.","Mu ttaka eritali ddene nnyo, enkola endala nga okusima emikono (augering) zirina okukozesebwa."
"In consolidated ground, including rock formations, the well may stand unlined but the upper section should always have a lining.","Mu ttaka erigatta, omuli n’okutondebwa kw’amayinja, oluzzi luyinza okuyimirira nga terulina layini naye ekitundu eky’okungulu bulijjo kirina okuba n’ekisenge."
"However, in fine sand aquifers, the lining should not have openings or perforations, so that water only enters through the bottom of the well.","Naye mu bifo ebirimu amazzi amalungi, ekisenge tekirina kuba na bifo oba ebituli, amazzi ne gayingira nga gayita wansi w’oluzzi lwokka."
"The bottom of the well should be covered with graded gravel consisting of a 150mm thick layer of grain sizes 1-2mm overlain by a 150mm layer of grain sizes 4-8mm and this should be topped by a 150mm thick layer of grain sizes 20-30mm, to form a proper filter.","Wansi w’oluzzi olina okubikkibwako amayinja agasengekeddwa nga galimu oluwuzi oluwanvu olwa mm 150 olw’obunene bw’empeke mm 1-2 ezibikkiddwako layeri ya mm 150 ey’obunene bw’empeke mm 4-8 era kino kirina okussibwako waggulu n’oluwuzi oluwanvu olwa mm 150 olw’obunene bw’empeke 20-30mm, okukola omusengejja omutuufu."
"The upper part of the lining should be water tight, to a depth of several meters below the lowest draw-down water level in the well.","Ekitundu eky’okungulu ekya lining kirina okuba nga kinywezeddwa amazzi, okutuuka ku buziba bwa mita eziwerako wansi w’amazzi agasinga wansi agasika wansi mu luzzi."
"The annular space between the well walls and the lining should be sealed with puddle clay or cement grout, from the ground surface to the top of the aquifer or to at least 2m below the ground surface.","Ekifo eky’omu bbanga wakati w’ebisenge by’oluzzi n’olutimbe gulina okussibwako ebbumba ly’ekinnya oba seminti, okuva waggulu ku ttaka okutuuka waggulu w’amazzi oba okutuuka ku waakiri mita 2 wansi w’ettaka."
"The top of the lining should be extended to about 0.5m above the ground surface level, to form a wall around the well.","Waggulu ku lining olina okugaziwa okutuuka ku 0.5m waggulu w’omutindo gw’oku ttaka, okukola ekisenge okwetooloola oluzzi."
The well top should be sealed with a water-tight slab.,Oluzzi waggulu lulina okusibirwako n’olutimbe oluziyiza amazzi.
A manhole that can tightly and securely locked should be provided for the inspection and disinfection of the water in the well.,Manhole esobola okusibirwa obulungi era ennywevu erina okuweebwa okukeberebwa n’okutta obuwuka amazzi mu luzzi.
Source: Sustainable Sanitation and Water Management The term rainwater harvesting is usually taken to mean the immediate collection of rainwater running off surfaces upon which it has fallen directly.,Source: Obuyonjo n’okuddukanya amazzi mu ngeri ey’olubeerera Ekigambo okukungula amazzi g’enkuba kitera okutwalibwa nga kitegeeza okukung’aanya amangu amazzi g’enkuba agakulukuta okuva ku ngulu kwe gagudde butereevu.
"Where there is no surface water, or where groundwater is deep or inaccessible due to hard ground conditions, or where it is too salty, acidic or otherwise unpleasant or unfit to drink, another source must be sought.","Awali amazzi ag’okungulu, oba amazzi agali wansi w’ettaka we gabeera amawanvu oba nga tegasobola kutuukirirwa olw’embeera y’ettaka enkalu, oba nga galimu omunnyo omungi, nga ga asidi oba mu ngeri endala nga tegasanyusa oba nga tegasaanira kunywa, ensibuko endala erina okunoonyezebwa."

Asbestos sheeting or lead-painted surfaces should be avoided due to their adverse health effects.,Asbestos sheeting oba lead-painted surfaces zirina okwewalibwa olw’obuzibu bwabyo mu bulamu.
"The installation of gutters on roofs should take into consideration of the following: Gutters should be of either square or half circular section made from PVC or galvanized Gutters should be put in position using gutter brackets, made from PVC or metal stripes fixed to the fascia board of the building;","Okuteeka emifulejje ku busolya kulina okulowooza ku bino wammanga: Emifulejje girina okuba egy’ekitundu kya square oba ekitundu ekyekulungirivu ekikoleddwa okuva mu PVC oba galvanized gutters zirina okuteekebwa mu kifo nga tukozesa emidumu, egyakolebwa okuva mu PVC oba emisono egy’ebyuma egyateekebwa ku fascia board y’ekizimbe;"
"For very long gutters (>15m) fixed on fascia boards, the slope can be varied such that the first half of the gutters is laid at 0.5% slope and the rest at 1% slope to maintain reasonable gap between the gutter and the edge of the roof; (iv)	 Starting from the end nearest the tank, gutters should be laid into the brackets so that the next gutter sits inside a previous one with a 20cm overlap.","Ku mifulejje emiwanvu ennyo (>15m) egyateekebwa ku bipande bya fascia, omusenyu guyinza okukyusibwakyusibwa nga ekitundu ekisooka eky’emifulejje kiteekebwa ku 0.5% okuserengeta ate okusigadde ku 1% okuserengeta okukuuma ekituli ekituufu wakati w’omudumu n’olukonko lw’akasolya; (iv) Okutandika okuva ku nkomerero eri okumpi ne ttanka, emifulejje girina okuteekebwa mu bbulakisi olwo omusulo oguddako gutuule munda mu gwasooka nga gukwatagana ne sentimita 20."
The brackets should be positioned such that it falls in the center of the overlap; and (v)	 The end of the gutters toward the tank should be provided with a down pipe and a purpose made first flush system; (vi)	 The ends of the gutter should be blocked with stoppers to reduce water loss.,Ebikwaso bisaana okuteekebwa mu kifo nga bigwa wakati mu kukwatagana; ne (v) enkomerero y’emifulejje egy’okwolekera ttanka erina okuweebwa payipu ekka wansi n’ekigendererwa ekikoleddwa mu nkola esooka ey’okufuuwa; (vi) Enkomerero z’omusulo zirina okuzibikira n’ebiziyiza okukendeeza ku kufiirwa amazzi.
"This introduces harmful bacteria in to storage water system, which can cause serious illness.","Kino kireeta obuwuka obw’obulabe mu nkola y’okutereka amazzi, ekiyinza okuleeta obulwadde obw’amaanyi."
"In order to avoid this, routinely sweeping of the roof and removal of debris from gutters is reacquired.","Okusobola okwewala kino, okusenya akasolya buli kiseera n’okuggya ebifunfugu mu mifulejje kiddamu okufunibwa."
"As a rough guide, the minimum storage capacity of a first flush device should be equivalent to 1mm of rainfall over the catchment area developed.","Nga ekiragiro ekikaluba, obusobozi obutono obw’okutereka ekyuma ekisooka okufuukuula bulina okwenkanankana n’enkuba eya mm 1 ku kifo ekikuŋŋaanyizibwamu amazzi ekyakolebwa."

Cleaning is done by shutting the main line valve and opening the discharge line.,Okwoza kukolebwa nga oggalawo vvaalu ya layini enkulu n’okuggulawo layini y’okufulumya.
The reservoir is constructed with a slope towards the drain line to simplify cleaning.,Ekidiba kino kizimbibwa n’okuserengeta okwolekera layini y’amazzi agafuluma okusobola okwanguyiza okuyonja.
Reservoirs should have an overflow line that can support the maximum anticipated overflow.,Ebifo ebitereka amazzi birina okuba ne layini y’okukulukuta esobola okuwagira okusukkiridde okusuubirwa okusingawo.
The overflow pipes should be at least 50% larger than the inlet pipes and should be well screened and covered.,Payipu ezikulukuta zirina okuba nga zisingako ebitundu 50% okusinga payipu eziyingira era nga zirina okukeberebwa obulungi era nga zibikkiddwa.
It should be possible to observe the overflow so that the inlets can,Kisaanye okusoboka okwetegereza okujjula olwo ebiyingira bisobole .

"To ensure adequate disinfection, a contact time of at least 30 minutes should be allowed between the moment the chlorine is added to the water and the moment the water is available for consumption or use.","Okukakasa okutta obuwuka obumala, ekiseera ky’okukwatagana eky’eddakiika ezitakka wansi wa 30 kisaana okukkirizibwa wakati w’akaseera chlorine lw’ateekebwa mu mazzi era akaseera amazzi we gaba osobola okulikozesa oba okukozesebwa."
"The free chlorine residual (the free form of chlorine remaining in the water) after the contact time should be between 0.5 and 1.0 milligrams per litre  in all points of the system, including end-points.","Ekisigadde kya chlorine eky’eddembe (ekika kya chlorine eky’eddembe ekisigadde mu mazzi) oluvannyuma lw’ekiseera ky’okukwatagana kirina okuba wakati wa 0.5 ne 1.0 buli liita mu bifo byonna eby’enkola, nga mw’otwalidde n’enkomerero."
Residual chlorine can be measured with simple equipment (e.g.,Chlorine asigaddewo asobola okupimibwa n’ebyuma ebyangu (e.g.
Mains supply water may need supplementary chlorination to ensure adequate disinfection and a sufficient level of residual chlorine up to the point of consumption or use.,Amazzi agagaba amazzi agava mu masannyalaze gayinza okwetaaga okugassa mu mubiri (supplementary chlorination) okukakasa obuwuka obumala okutta obuwuka n’omutindo ogumala ogwa chlorine ogusigaddewo okutuuka ku kifo we gukozesebwa oba okukozesebwa.
Stored water may also need supplementary chlorination before use.,Amazzi agaterekeddwa nago gayinza okwetaaga okufuuka chlorination ey’okugatta nga tonnaba kugakozesa.
Effective disinfection requires that the water has a low turbidity.,Okutta obuwuka obulungi kyetaagisa amazzi okuba n’obuwuka obutono.
"Ideally, median turbidity should be below 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) .","Ekisinga obulungi, obuwufu obw’omu makkati bulina okuba wansi w’ekitundu 1 eky’obuwuka obuyitibwa nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) ."
"However, 5 NTU is the minimum turbidity measurable with simple equipment (turbidity tube), so this level may be used in lowcost settings in practice.","Naye, 5 NTU ye turbidity esinga obutono epimibwa n’ebyuma ebyangu (turbidity tube), kale omutendera guno guyinza okukozesebwa mu lowcost settings mu nkola."
"If turbidity exceeds 5 NTU then the water should be treated to remove suspended matter before disinfection, by sedimentation (with or without coagulation and flocculation) and/or filtration.","Singa obuwuka obuyitibwa turbidity busukka 5 NTU olwo amazzi galina okujjanjabibwa okuggyawo ekintu ekiyimiriziddwa nga tekinnatta buwuka, nga kiyita mu kusengejja (nga kirimu oba nga tekirina kuzimba n’okufuumuuka) ne/oba okusengejja."

Designing of sanitation facilities should be part of the initial HCF planning.,Okukola dizayini y’ebifo eby’obuyonjo kulina okuba ekitundu ku nteekateeka ya HCF esooka.
"However, where sanitation infrastructure and services are inadequate it is equally important to plan for construction of new ones or upgrading the existing facilities.","Naye, ebikozesebwa n’obuweereza bw’obuyonjo we bitamala kikulu kyenkanyi okuteekateeka okuzimba ebipya oba okulongoosa ebifo ebiriwo."

It is important that toilet cisterns work properly all the time.,Kikulu nti ebiyumba bya kaabuyonjo okukola obulungi buli kiseera.
"If they do not work, the sewage is left in the toilet pan.","Bwe batakola, amazzi amakyafu galekebwa mu kaabuyonjo."

"Instead, their drain pipes are connected to waste conveyance and waste treatment systems.13 For maintenance and hygiene purposes the following practices are recommended: Users of flush toilets should be reminded through a visibly displayed poster that they must flush and leave the toilet clean after use; The cleaners should clean the flush toilet with a toilet brush and detergents; (iii)	 There should be a cleaning schedule that shows the cleaning time and a supervisors verification column that is signed to indicate monitoring for cleanliness; (iv)	 Periodic checks on effective functioning of the flush toilets in the HCF should be carried out to identify any mechanical faults especially the blockage of wastewater flow due to the faulty cistern mechanism; (v)	 Since in many cases flush toilets are located within the buildings, rectification of such faults should be done immediately otherwise flies could be easily attracted within the premises of the HCFs.","Wabula, payipu zazo ezifulumya amazzi ziyungibwa ku nkola y’okutambuza kasasiro n’okulongoosa kasasiro.13 Okusobola okuddaabiriza n’obuyonjo Enkola zino wammanga ze zirungi: Abakozesa kaabuyonjo ezifuumuuka zirina okujjukizibwa nga bayita mu kipande ekirabiddwa mu ngeri erabika nti balina okufuumuula n’okuleka kaabuyonjo nga nnyonjo nga bamaze okugikozesa; Abayonja balina okuyonja kaabuyonjo efuukuuse nga bakozesa bbulawuzi ya kaabuyonjo n’eby’okunaaba; (iii) Wabeewo enteekateeka y’okuyonja eraga obudde bw’okuyonja n’omuko ogw’okukakasa abalabirira ogussiddwako omukono okulaga okulondoola obuyonjo; (iv) Okukebera buli luvannyuma lwa kiseera ku nkola ennungamu eya kaabuyonjo ezifuumuuka mu HCF kulina okukolebwa okuzuula ensobi zonna ez’ebyuma naddala okuzibikira kw’amazzi amakyafu agakulukuta olw’enkola ya cistern eriko obuzibu; (v) Okuva bwe kiri nti mu mbeera nnyingi kaabuyonjo ezifuumuuka zisangibwa mu bizimbe, okutereeza ensobi ng’ezo kulina okukolebwa amangu ddala mu ngeri endala ensekere kuyinza okwanguyirwa okusikiriza munda mu kifo kya HCFS."
"Rectification is also important to avoid bad smell from blocked (vi)	 Bed pans should be immediately cleaned and disinfected after being used by the The amount of water used by conventional flush toilets usually makes up a significant portion of personal daily water usage in HCFs especially those with relatively high numbers of HCWs, patients and carers.","Okutereeza nakyo kikulu okwewala okuwunya obubi okuva mu bipande by’ekitanda ebizibiddwa (vi) kulina okuyonjebwa amangu ddala n’okutta obuwuka oluvannyuma lw’okukozesebwa omuwendo gw’amazzi agakozesebwa kaabuyonjo eza bulijjo ezifuumuuka zitera okukola ekitundu ekinene eky’okukozesa amazzi ga buli lunaku mu HCFs naddala ezo ezirina omuwendo omunene ogwa HCW, abalwadde n’abalabirira."

Ventilated Improved Pit Latrines The VIP latrine is an improvement over the simple dry pit latrine.,Latrine ezirongooseddwa mu binnya ezirongooseddwa VIP kaabuyonjo nnongoosereza ku kaabuyonjo ennyangu ey’ekinnya ekikalu.
"The distinctive feature that gives the VIP latrine its name is the vent pipe installed into the pit, which is used to exhaust the foul odour from the pit and control flies ( The national guidelines for water, sanitation and hygiene in health care facilities  The United Republic of Tanzania, 2017","Ekintu eky’enjawulo ekiwa kaabuyonjo ya VIP erinnya lyayo ye payipu y’okufulumya empewo essiddwa mu kinnya, ekozesebwa okumalawo akawoowo akavundu mu kinnya n’enseenene ezifuga ( Endagiriro y’eggwanga ku mazzi, obuyonjo n’obuyonjo mu bifo eby’obulamu United Republic of Tanzania, 2017 2017"
The principle is that a continuous flow of air comes in through the superstructure and enters the pit through the hole.,Omusingi guli nti empewo egenda mu maaso eyingira ng’eyita mu kisenge ekinene (superstructure) n’eyingira mu kinnya ng’eyita mu kinnya.
The other advantage of the vent is controlling flies.,Ekirungi ekirala ekiri mu vent kwe kufuga ensekere.
Newly-emerging adult flies will try to escape through the vent pipe because the pipe allows sunlight to enter into the pit and flies are photopositive (meaning they move towards light) by nature.,Enseenene z’abantu abakulu ezipya zijja kugezaako okutoloka nga ziyita mu payipu y’okufulumya omukka kubanga payipu esobozesa omusana okuyingira mu kinnya era ensekere zibeera za kitangaala (kitegeeza nti zitambula nga zigenda mu kitangaala) mu butonde.
The vent pipe should have an internal diameter of 110150 mm and reach more than 500 mm above the highest point of the roof.,Payipu y’okufulumya omukka erina okuba ne mm 110150 munda era etuuka ku mm ezisukka mu 500 waggulu w’ekifo ekisinga okuba waggulu ku kasolya.
The vent works better in windy areas but where there is not much wind its effectiveness can be improved by painting the pipe black.,Ekyuma ekifulumya empewo kikola bulungi mu bitundu ebirimu empewo naye nga tewali mpewo nnyingi obulungi bwayo busobola okulongoosebwa nga tusiiga payipu omuddugavu.
It is very important to ensure that the vent pipe is straight and vertical in order to allow as much light as possible to shine down the pipe into the pit and so attract any newly emergent flies up The bottom of the vent pipe should be securely fixed into a hole in the pit cover slab.,Kikulu nnyo okukakasa nti payipu y’okufulumya empewo egolokofu era yeesimbye okusobola okukkiriza ekitangaala ekinene nga bwe kisoboka okumasamasa wansi mu payipu mu kinnya era bwe kityo okusikiriza enseenene zonna ezipya ezifuluma wansi wansi wa payipu y’okufulumya empewo erina okunywezebwa obulungi mu kinnya mu kinnya ekibikka ekinnya.
The vent pipe should be attached to the wall of the superstructure with steel straps or galvanized steel wire.,Payipu y’okufulumya omukka erina okussibwa ku bbugwe w’ekizimbe ekiyitibwa ‘superstructure’ ng’eriko obuguwa obw’ekyuma oba waya y’ekyuma eriko ‘galvanized’.
"To test the efficacy of the ventilation, a small, smoky fire can be lit in the pit; the smoke should be pulled up and out of the vent pipe and not remain in the pit or the superstructure.","okugezesa obulungi bw’empewo, omuliro omutono ogufuuwa omukka guyinza okukoleezebwa mu kinnya; Omukka gulina okusimbulwa waggulu ne gufuluma mu payipu y’okufulumya omukka n’otosigala mu kinnya oba mu kisenge ekinene."
For PVC pipes sandpaper the top of the pipe so there are no sharp edges that will cut the netting.,Ku payipu za PVC sandpaper waggulu wa payipu kale tewali mbiriizi nsongovu ezigenda okusala akatimba.
An alternative is to make a collar from a cut section of pipe and snap this over the mesh.,Eky’okuddako kwe kukola enkokola okuva mu kitundu kya payipu ekisaliddwa n’osika kino ku mesh.
Aluminium screens with a hole size of 1.21.5 mm have proved to be the most effective.15 Inspect the fly screen regularly at intervals of six months or less.,Aluminiyamu screens ezirina ekituli ekinene nga 1.21.5 mm ziraga nti ze zisinga okukola.15 Kebera enseenene bulijjo mu bbanga lya myezi mukaaga oba wansi.

Hand hygiene is the most effective method of preventing transfer of micro-organisms between personnel and patients within the health care facility.,Obuyonjo mu ngalo y’enkola esinga okukola obulungi ey’okuziyiza okutambuza ebiramu ebitonotono wakati w’abakozi n’abalwadde mu kifo ky’ebyobulamu.
The purpose is to reduce resident and transient organisms.,Ekigendererwa kwe kukendeeza ku biramu ebibeera mu kitundu kino n’eby’ekiseera.
"Appropriate hand washing is achieved through using soap, running water and friction.","Okunaaba mu ngalo okutuufu kutuukirizibwa nga tuyita mu kukozesa ssabbuuni, amazzi agakulukuta n’okusikagana."
"Patients, care takers and health workers should be instructed in proper hand washing before eating, after toilet and when soiled.","Abalwadde, abalabirira n’abakozi b’ebyobulamu balina okulagirwa okunaaba mu ngalo mu ngeri entuufu nga tebannalya, oluvannyuma lwa kaabuyonjo n’okufuuka omucaafu."
"Appropriate hand washing is achieved through use of soap, running water and friction.","Okunaaba mu ngalo okutuufu kutuukirizibwa nga tuyita mu kukozesa ssabbuuni, amazzi agakulukuta n’okusikagana."
"Health workers should wash their hands properly before and after handling patients, equipment or Instructions prior to hand washing: Remove all jewellery, wet hands, apply detergent, use enough friction to cover all areas of your hands.","Abakozi b’ebyobulamu balina okunaaba obulungi mu ngalo nga tebannakwata balwadde, ebyuma oba ebiragiro nga tebannanaaba mu ngalo: Ggyako eby’okwewunda byonna, emikono emibisi, siiga eddagala ery’okunaaba, kozesa okusikagana okumala okubikka ebitundu byonna eby’emikono."
"The steps to be followed while performing antiseptic hand washing are similar to Healthcare facilities should make available alcohol rubs (Alcohol - based rub, Ethanol 70-90%, Isopropyl 60-70%, methanol) at points of care and should conform to the national specifications for alcohol-based hand hygiene products.","Emitendera egigenda okugobererwa nga okola okunaaba mu ngalo okutta obuwuka bifaanagana n’ebifo eby’obulamu birina okukola okunywa omwenge (Alcohol - based rub, ethanol 70-90%, isopropyl 60-70%, methanol) mu bifo eby’okulabirira era birina okutuukana n’ebiragiro by’eggwanga ebikwata ku mwenge ogukolebwa mu ngalo obuyonjo mu ngalo."
The alcohol rub should be kept in secure place in order to avoid risk of accidental or intentional ingestion at the point of care by individual patient.,Okusiiga omwenge kulina okukuumibwa mu kifo ekikuumiddwa okusobola okwewala obulabe bw’okumira mu butanwa oba mu bugenderevu mu kifo ky’okulabirira omulwadde ssekinnoomu.
It should be applied when hands are not visibly soiled in order to decontaminate hands for seconds or until dry and should follow the steps illustrated in,Kisaanye okusiigibwa ng’emikono tegiri mu buvundu mu ngeri erabika okusobola okulongoosa emikono okumala sekondi oba okutuusa nga gikaze era nga gigoberere emitendera egilagiddwa mu .
"In case there are, cover them with occlusive waterproof dressing Sleeves must be short to allow scrubbing up to the elbows Keep nails short and clean without nail polish Keep the soap and soap dispensers clean; In case plain soap is used, care should be taken to avoid contamination of the soap and soap dispensers as they may act as reservoirs of bacteria if not cleaned properly between uses.","Mu mbeera nga waliwo, zibikkeko emikono egy’okusiiga amazzi egitayingiramu mazzi girina okuba emimpi okusobozesa okusiimuula okutuuka ku bikoona okukuuma emisumaali nga mimpi ate nga giyonjo nga tegiriimu nail polish kukuuma ssabbuuni ne ssabbuuni nga biyonjo; Mu mbeera nga ssabbuuni eya bulijjo akozesebwa, okwegendereza kulina okutwalibwa okwewala obucaafu bwa ssabbuuni ne ssabbuuni ebigaba ssabbuuni kuba biyinza okukola ng’ebiterekero bya bakitiriya singa tebiyonjebwa bulungi wakati w’okukozesa."
"Rub palms to palms, fingers interlaced for both hands, continue into rotational rubbing back and forth with clasped fingers of right into left and vice versa ensuring that nails and nail beds are cleaned with a single use disposable scrubbing brush.","Siiga engalo ku ngalo, engalo eziyungiddwa ku mikono gyombi, genda mu maaso n’okusika okusiiga okudda n’okudda n’engalo ezikutte ku ddyo mu kkono n’ekirala okukakasa nti emisumaali n’ebitanda by’emisumaali biyonjebwa ne bbulawuzi emu ey’okusiimuula ekozesebwa omulundi gumu."
The hands should not be scrubbed to avoid skin damage.,Emikono tegisaanidde kusiigibwa okwewala okwonooneka kw’olususu.
The scrubbing procedure should not take less than 5 minutes.,Enkola y’okusiimuula tesaana kutwala ddakiika ezitakka wansi wa 5.
"Rinse off 2nd wash the lather again starting from hands to elbows, may repeat antiseptic wash by giving a final wash to the hands.","Oyozeeko 2nd okunaaba ekikuta nate okutandika emikono okutuuka ku bikoona, oyinza okuddamu okunaaba antiseptic ng’owa okunaaba okusembayo ku ngalo."

Drying of Hands and Arms after Surgical Scrubbing The principle of drying hands is to ensure removal of excess water and reduction of bacterial count of all transient micro-organisms.,Okukala emikono n’emikono oluvannyuma lw’okulongoosebwa okusiimuula omusingi gw’okukaza emikono kwe kukakasa okuggyawo amazzi agasukkiridde n’okukendeeza ku bungi bwa bakitiriya obw’obuwuka bwonna obw’akaseera obuseera.
Hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene.,Okukala n’emikono kitundu kikulu nnyo mu buyonjo bw’emikono.
"Wet hands have high bacterial count and lead to dryness, cracked skin and increased latex allergies, for all drying purposes single use cotton towels are referred to here.","Emikono emibisi giba n’obuwuka bungi era givaako okukala, olususu okukutuka n’okwongera ku alergy ya latex, olw’ebigendererwa byonna eby’okukala obutambaala bwa ppamba obw’okukozesa omulundi gumu byogerwako wano."
"The opposite side of the towel should dry the corresponding hand by blotting the skin dry in a corkscrew motion beginning with the fingers up to the elbow, while the other side will be used to blot the hand that picked the towel from the pack, following the same process.","Oludda olulala olw’akatambaala kalina okukala omukono ogukwatagana nga gusiigibwa olususu ne gukala mu ntambula ya kkokscrew nga gutandika n’engalo okutuuka ku nkokola, ate oludda olulala lujja kukozesebwa okunyiga omukono ogwalonda akatambaala okuva mu paaka, nga gugoberera enkola y’emu."
"However, if 2 towels are provided discard the first, and using the 2nd towel.","Naye singa obutambaala 2 buweebwa suulamu ekisooka, n’okozesa akatambaala ak’okubiri."
"Illustration for hand drying using a towel Source: Kagga & Partners - Guidelines for WASH in Healthcare Facilities, 2021 Communal towels have been recognized as sources of cross-infection and Disposable paper towels or single use (reusable) cotton towels are The use of hot air driers is not recommended and should be discouraged","Ekyokulabirako eky’okukaza n’emikono nga tukozesa ensibuko y’akatambaala: Kagga & Partners - Endagiriro z’okunaaba mu bifo eby’obulamu, obutambaala obw’awamu obwa 2021 bumanyiddwa ng’ensibuko z’okusalako okusalako n’obutambaala bw’empapula obukozesebwa omulundi gumu oba okukozesebwa omulundi gumu (reusable) ppamba kwe kukozesa ebyuma ebiwola empewo eyokya si kirungi era kisaana okusazibwamu"
"Hand washing facilities including low cost models (hand washing basins, running water, lever taps among others) should be made available in various locations of the facilities as listed below:At stations near the main entrance/gate of the HCF Medical examination rooms Within or at the entry / exit of the toilet Breast feeding / nutrition corners And any other convenient location determined by HCF In-charge These should be regularly serviced and maintained to ensure constant availability.","Ebifo eby’okwoza emikono omuli ebikozesebwa eby’ebbeeyi entono (ebifo eby’okunaaba mu ngalo, amazzi agakulukuta, ttaapu za leeva n’ebirala) birina okuteekebwa mu bifo eby’enjawulo eby’ebifo nga bwe biwandiikiddwa wansi:Ku siteegi okumpi n’omulyango omukulu/omulyango gw’ebisenge by’abasawo eby’obujjanjabi eby’obujjanjabi munda oba ku kuyingira / okufuluma kw’okuyonsa kaabuyonjo / endya enkoona n’ensonda endala yonna enyangu esalirwawo HCF mu kusasula kuno kuno kulina okubeera nga zikolebwako buli kiseera era nga zikuumibwa bulungi."

The main features of a scrub sink include: Digital timer - is used to ensure that the proper amount of time is spent on hand hygiene before entering the operating room.,Ebikulu ebiva mu sinki ya scrub mulimu: Digital timer - ekozesebwa okukakasa nti obudde obutuufu bumala mu buyonjo mu ngalo nga tonnayingira mu kisenge omulongoosebwa.
Faucet - is an important feature of a scrub set because it delivers the water for the hand scrubbing process.,Faucet - kikulu nnyo mu scrub set kubanga etuusa amazzi g’enkola y’okusiimuula omukono.
"It should offer non-aerated, consistent water flow with either shower head or laminae properties.","Lirina okuwa amazzi agatali ga aaerated, agakwatagana nga galina oba ga shower head oba laminae properties."
Soap dispenser - a proper dose of surgical scrub chemistry is also important when selecting a scrub sink.,Soap Dispenser - Dozi entuufu ey’okulongoosa kemiko w’okusiimuula nayo nsonga nkulu ng’olonda sinki ya scrub.
"The soap is dispensed by a hand pump, foot pump, knee operation or infrared methods.","Sabbuuni ono aweebwa ppampu y’omu ngalo, ppampu y’ebigere, okukola okugulu oba enkola ya infrared."
Water control - water control on a scrub sink may be operated by hand or automated.,Okufuga amazzi - Okufuga amazzi ku sinki efulumye kuyinza okukolebwa n’engalo oba mu ngeri ey’otoma.
"Station / bay - scrub sinks maybe constructed with one, two or three stations at which multiple members or staff can wash their hands at the same time.","Station / Bay - Scrub sinks Oboolyawo nga zizimbibwa ne siteegi emu, bbiri oba ssatu nga bammemba oba abakozi abawera basobola okunaaba mu ngalo mu kiseera kye kimu."
The distance from the ground at which the scrub sink is mounted is critical because it determines the level of decontamination and sterilization.,Ebanga okuva ku ttaka sinki y’ebizigo gy’eteekebwa kikulu nnyo kubanga esalawo omutindo gw’okulongoosa n’okuzaala.
"Critical Moments of Hand Hygiene in HCFs Hand Hygiene in Patient Handling Care has to be taken before, during and after handling or touching a patient, and in handling food for therapeutic care.","Ebiseera ebikulu eby‟obuyonjo bw‟emikono mu HCFS emikono mu kukwata engalo mu kulabirira omulwadde birina okukolebwa nga tonnakwata, nga bakwata oba nga bakwata ku mulwadde, n‟okukwata emmere okulabirira obujjanjabi."
"Critical moments of hand hygiene (5 moments of hand hygiene) during patient care are illustrated in these critical moments as they can easily contaminate their hands at different occasions such as lifting a patient, wound dressing, taking a patients pulse, blood pressure, or oral temperature, touching a patients hand, shoulder or groin.","Ebiseera ebikulu eby’obuyonjo bw’omukono (5 moments of hand hygiene) mu kiseera ky’okulabirira omulwadde biragiddwa mu biseera bino ebizibu kuba basobola bulungi okufuula emikono gyabwe okufuula emikono egy’enjawulo ng’okusitula omulwadde, okwambala ebiwundu, okumira abalwadde okukuba, puleesa, oba ebbugumu ly’omu kamwa, okukwata ku mukono gw’abalwadde, ekibegabega oba ekisambi."
"There should be sufficient and functional, hand hygiene facilities to ensure health care workers, caregivers and patients can carry out hand hygiene at all five key moments.","Wabeewo ebifo ebimala era ebikola, eby’obuyonjo mu ngalo okulaba ng’abakozi b’ebyobulamu, abalabirira n’abalwadde basobola okukola obuyonjo mu ngalo mu biseera byonna ebitaano ebikulu."

"Other Critical Moments of Hand Hygiene The other critical moments for proper hand washing in HCFs environment include: Before entering and leaving inpatient wards or any working area of the health facility Before and after feeding a patient; After contact with inanimate surfaces and objects in the immediate vicinity of the Before and after serving food; After visiting the toilet; When hands are visibly dirty, or soiled with blood or other body fluids; Before putting on gloves and immediately after removing gloves; Before and after caring for any patient.","Ebiseera ebirala ebikulu eby’obuyonjo bw’emikono Ebiseera ebirala ebikulu eby’okunaaba n’emikono mu ngeri entuufu mu mbeera ya HCFS mulimu: nga tonnayingira n’okuleka waadi z’abalwadde abajjanjabirwa mu ddwaaliro oba ekifo kyonna eky’okukoleramu eky’ekifo ky’ebyobulamu nga tonnaba kuliisa mulwadde n’oluvannyuma lw’okuliisa; oluvannyuma lw’okukwatagana n’ebintu ebitali biramu n’ebintu ebiri mu kitundu ekiriraanye amangu ddala nga tonnaba kugabula mmere n’oluvannyuma lw’okugabula emmere; Oluvannyuma lw’okukyalira kaabuyonjo; Emikono bwe giba nga girabika nga gicaafu, oba nga gifuuse omusaayi oba amazzi amalala ag’omubiri; nga tonnaba kwambala ggalavu era amangu ddala ng’omaze okuggyamu ggalavu; Nga tonnalabirira mulwadde yenna n’oluvannyuma lw’okumulabirira."
"Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette is a standard precaution that should be applied by all patients, visitors and HCWs to contain respiratory secretions (e.g.","Obuyonjo mu kussa n’empisa z’okusesema bwe bugenderevu obw’omutindo obulina okukozesebwa abalwadde bonna, abagenyi ne HCWs okubeera n’ebifulumizibwa mu kussa (e.g."
Persons with respiratory symptoms should apply the following source control measures: Cover their nose and mouth when coughing/sneezing with tissue or mask.,Abantu abalina obubonero bw’okussa balina okusiiga ebipimo bino wammanga eby’okufuga ensibuko: bikka ennyindo n’akamwa nga basesema/okusesema n’ebitundu by’omubiri oba masiki.
"If no tissues are available, cough or sneeze into the inner elbow rather than hand; Do not spit in environment (use tissue instead); Dispose of used tissues and masks; Avoid shaking hands when sick; and Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions.","Singa tewabaawo bitundu bya bitundu, okusesema oba okusesema mu nkokola ey’omunda okusinga mu ngalo; Tofuuwa malusu mu butonde (kozesa ebitundu by’omubiri mu kifo ky’ekyo); Suula ebitundu ebikozesebwa n’ebizigo ebikozesebwa; Weewale okukwatagana mu ngalo ng’olwadde; n’okukola obuyonjo mu ngalo oluvannyuma lw’okukwatagana n’ebifulumya omukka."
"HCFs should promote respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette by: Educating HCF staff, patients, family members, and visitors on the importance of containing respiratory droplet/ aerosol and secretions to prevent the transmission of infectious disease (e.g.","HCFs zirina okutumbula obuyonjo bw’okussa n’empisa z’okusesema nga: Okusomesa abakozi ba HCF, abalwadde, ab’omu maka, n’abagenyi ku bukulu bw’okuziyiza amatondo g’okussa/ aerosol n’okufuluma okuziyiza okusaasaana kw’obulwadde obusiigibwa (e.g."

Cleaning is the single most step in making a medical device ready for re-use.,Okwoza gwe mutendera gumu ogusinga mu kukola ekyuma eky’obujjanjabi nga kyetegefu okuddamu okukozesebwa.
Further processing (disinfection and sterilization) of equipment that does not include cleaning can fail because microorganisms can be protected inside the residual organic matter.,Okwongera okulongoosa (okutta obuwuka n’okuziyiza) ebyuma ebitaliimu kuyonja kuyinza okulemererwa kubanga obuwuka obutonotono busobola okukuumibwa munda mu kintu ekisigaddewo.
"In practice, cleanliness is based on visual inspection, whether the instrument is visibly clean.","Mu nkola, obuyonjo bwesigamiziddwa ku kwekebejja okulaba, oba ekintu ekyo kirabika nga kiyonjo."
Disinfection is the process destroying or inhibiting disease producing microorganisms outside the body.,Okutta obuwuka mu nkola y’enkola esaanyaawo oba okuziyiza obulwadde obuvaamu obuwuka obutonotono ebweru w’omubiri.
It is the first step in processing equipment that has been in contact with blood and body fluids but it is also used for items that cannot undergo the sterilization process.,Ye ddaala erisooka mu kulongoosa ebyuma ebibadde bikwatagana n’omusaayi n’amazzi g’omubiri naye era bikozesebwa ku bintu ebitasobola kukola ku nkola y’okuzaala.
"High-Level Disinfection (HLD) High level disinfection is the process that eliminates all microorganisms except some bacterial endospores from inanimate objects by boiling, steaming or the use of chemical disinfectants.","Okutta obuwuka mu ddaala erya waggulu (HLD) Okutta obuwuka mu ngeri ey’ekika ekya waggulu y’enkola emalawo obuwuka bwonna okuggyako obuwuka obumu obuva mu bintu ebitali biramu nga bufumbira, okufuuwa omukka oba okukozesa eddagala eritta obuwuka."
"Sterilization is a process that eliminates all microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites) including bacterial endospores from inanimate objects by high-pressure steam (autoclave), dry heat (oven), chemical sterilants or radiation.","Okuzaala (sterilization) nkola emalawo obuwuka bwonna (bacteria, viruses, fungi ne parasites) omuli bacterial endospores okuva mu bintu ebitali biramu olw’omukka gwa puleesa enkulu (autoclave), ebbugumu erikaze (oven), eddagala erikola eddagala oba radiation."
"The guidelines on instrument hygiene processes are presented in Guidelines on Instrument Hygiene Process Soak in 0.5% chlorine solution for 10 All contaminated instruments and Soap, scrub brush, clean water Scrub and remove all tissue, blood, and decontamination and before further processing (sterilization or HLD) or Steam (autoclave at 121C, 106k.","Enkola ku nkola z’obuyonjo bw’ebikozesebwa biragiddwa mu ndagiriro ku nkola y’obuyonjo bw’ebikozesebwa Soak mu 0.5% chlorine solution for 10 byonna ebicaafu ebikozesebwa ne ssabbuuni, scrub brush, okusekula amazzi amayonjo n’okuggyawo ebitundu byonna, omusaayi, n’okulongoosa obucaafu era nga tebannaba kwongera kulongoosa (Sterilization oba HLD) oba steam (Autoclave ku 121C, 106k."
The objective of these guidelines is to minimize the risk of disease transmission and promote good hygienic practices in the processing of food at the health facility.,Ekigendererwa ky’enkola zino kwe kukendeeza ku bulabe bw’okusaasaanya endwadde n’okutumbula enkola ennungi ez’obuyonjo mu kulongoosa emmere mu kifo ky’ebyobulamu.
"Cleanliness and safe food preparation and storage practices are critical to: Preventing outbreaks of food borne illness among patients; Minimizing microbiologic contamination of food by using appropriate food handling techniques during the preparation of food; and Protecting food from contamination by insects, rodents and moisture.","Obuyonjo n’enkola y’okuteekateeka n’okutereka emmere mu ngeri ey’obukuumi kikulu nnyo eri: Okuziyiza obulwadde obubalukawo mu balwadde; okukendeeza ku bucaafu bw’emmere mu buwuka obutonotono nga tukozesa obukodyo obutuufu obw’okukwata emmere mu kiseera ky’okuteekateeka emmere; n’okukuuma emmere obutafuuka bucaafu olw’ebiwuka, ebiwuka n’obunnyogovu."
This becomes more important in the kitchen environment where the tendency for infection is high due to the presence of patients suffering from various sicknesses and infections.,Kino kifuuka kikulu nnyo mu mbeera y’effumbiro ng’omuze gw’okukwatibwa obulwadde guli waggulu olw’okubeerawo kw’abalwadde abatawaanyizibwa obulwadde obw’enjawulo n’okukwatibwa yinfekisoni.
"Keep floor and working tops clean and dry Food waste and other rubbish should be put in containers that can be closed and these must be of appropriate construction, kept in sound condition, be easy to clean and where necessary, to disinfect.","Kuuma wansi n’okukola waggulu nga bikola ku kasasiro w’emmere omuyonjo era omukalu n’ebisasiro ebirala birina okuteekebwa mu bidomola ebiyinza okuggalwa era bino birina okuba eby’okuzimba okusaanidde, okukuumibwa mu mbeera y’amaloboozi, bibeere byangu okuyonja era we kyetaagisa, okutta obuwuka."
It is recommended that the management of the health care facility ensures regular supervision over the HCFs kitchens.,Kirungi enzirukanya y’ekifo ky’ebyobulamu ekakasa okulabirirwa buli kiseera ku mafumbiro ga HCFS.
"It is recommended that in health facilities where patients food is prepared by relatives there is access to proper hygienic equipment (cooking stoves, water, sinks, etc).","Kirungi nti mu bifo eby’obulamu abalwadde mwe babeera emmere etegekebwa ab’enganda waliwo okufuna ebyuma ebituufu eby’obuyonjo (sitoowa ezifumba, amazzi, sinki, n’ebirala)."
Educate relatives in food Food Handling and Preparation Food handlers should be trained in basic food safety.,Okusomesa ab’eŋŋanda mu kukwata emmere n’okuteekateeka emmere abakwata emmere balina okutendekebwa mu bukuumi bw’emmere obusookerwako.
"Soap and water should be available at all times during food preparation and handling, to ensure that hand washing is convenient.","Sabbuuni n’amazzi birina okubaawo ekiseera kyonna mu kiseera ky’okuteekateeka n’okukwata emmere, okukakasa nti okunaaba mu ngalo kirungi."
"If kitchen staff and carers have colds, influenza, diarrhoea, vomiting or throat and skin infections, or have suffered from diarrhoea and vomiting within the last 48 hours, they should not handle food unless it is packaged.","Singa abakozi b’omu ffumbiro n’abalabirira balina omusujja, ssennyiga, ekiddukano, okusiiyibwa oba okukwatibwa yinfekisoni z’olususu n’olususu, oba bafunye ekiddukano n’okusiiyibwa mu ssaawa 48 ezisembayo, tebalina kukwata mmere okuggyako ng’epakiddwa."
"All infections should be reported, and sick staff should not be penalized for reporting infections.","Yinfekisoni zonna zirina okuloopebwa, era abakozi abalwadde tebalina kubonerezebwa olw’okuloopa yinfekisoni."

Ensure fuel is available for operating the incinerator and that the waste to be Record the number of safety boxes and bags to be burned.,Kakasa nti amafuta galiwo okuddukanya ekyuma ekiyokya era nti kasasiro awandiike omuwendo gwa bbokisi z’obukuumi n’ensawo ezigenda okwokya.
"If you see smoke the temperature is too low If the temperature gets too high, add a bag of waste.","Bw’olaba omukka ebbugumu liba wansi nnyo singa ebbugumu liba lingi nnyo, ssaako ensawo ya kasasiro."
If you see fire in the chimney the temperature is too high.,Bw’olaba omuliro mu ssigiri ebbugumu lisusse.
"Very wet loads should be separated with drier material, and in extreme cases supplemented by an extra increment of diesel/kerosene.","Emigugu emibisi ennyo girina okwawulwamu ebintu ebikalu, era mu mbeera ezisukkiridde nga zongeddwaako okweyongera kwa dizero/kerosene."
"If the incinerator is being loaded with entirely plastic materials, such as syringes in sharps boxes, it is advisable to let one box burn almost completely before adding the next.","Singa ekyuma ekiyokya omuliro kiba kitikkibwako ebintu eby’obuveera byonna, gamba ng’empiso mu bbokisi ezisongovu, kirungi okuleka bbokisi emu okwokya kumpi ddala nga tonnaba kuteekamu kiddako."
The time can be gauged by noting when the smoke level decreases.,Ekiseera kiyinza okupimibwa nga otegeera ddi omukka lwe gukendeera.

"Just as domestic wastewater is considered to be potentially infectious, wastewater from health-care facilities must also be considered in a similar manner A proportion of the generated wastewater from health-care facilities will pose a higher risk than domestic wastewater.","Nga amazzi amakyafu ag’omunda bwe gatwalibwa ng’agayinza okusiigibwa, amazzi amakyafu agava mu bifo eby’obulamu nago galina okulowoozebwako mu ngeri y’emu ekitundu ky’amazzi amakyafu agakolebwa okuva mu bifo eby’obulamu kijja kuba kya bulabe bwa maanyi okusinga amazzi amakyafu ag’omu maka."
"Sewers of health-care facilities are often not watertight, and a significant part of the wastewater in many places may leak into the groundwater.","Emiryango gy’ebifo eby’obulamu gitera obutabeera na mazzi, era ekitundu ekinene eky’amazzi amakyafu mu bifo bingi giyinza okukulukuta mu mazzi agali wansi w’ettaka."
"Often, working sewage-treatment plants, and sometimes municipal sewerage networks may not even Improper management, collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and sludge will result in the pollution of local drinking water sources, or the contamination of natural resources.","Emirundi mingi, ebyuma ebikola amazzi amakyafu, n’oluusi emikutu gy’emyala gya munisipaali giyinza n’obutaba na kuddukanya mu ngeri etali ntuufu, okukung’aanya, okulongoosa n’okusuula amazzi amakyafu n’ebisasiro kijja kuvaamu obucaafu bw’ensulo z’amazzi ag’okunywa mu kitundu, oba okufuula eby’obugagga eby’omu ttaka obucaafu."
"Health and environmental implications of improper management of healthcare wastewater Excessive nutrients that cause biological degradation in groundwater, lakes and rivers by using up oxygen (eutrophication) resulting in algal blooms and biotoxins; Pharmaceuticals in water may act as endocrine disruptors; Antibiotics could result in antibiotic-resistant pathogens; Mercury and heavy metal poisoning; Water-borne disease outbreaks in communities like Campylobacterosis, cholera, Hepatitis A and E, schistosomiasis, and typhoid fever; Numerous vector-borne diseases (e.g.","ebyobulamu n’obutonde ebiva mu kuddukanya obubi ebyobulamu amazzi amakyafu ebiriisa ebisusse ebivaako okuvunda kw’ebiramu mu mazzi agali wansi w’ettaka, ennyanja n’emigga nga tukozesa omukka gwa oxygen (eutrophication) ekivaamu okufuumuuka kw’ebiwuka ebiyitibwa algal blooms ne biotoxins; eddagala mu mazzi liyinza okukola ng’ebitabangula endocrine; Eddagala eritta obuwuka liyinza okuvaamu obuwuka obuleeta obuwuka obuleeta endwadde; mercury n’obutwa obw’ebyuma ebizito; Obulwadde obuva ku mazzi obubalukawo mu bitundu nga campylobacterosis, kkolera, hepatitis A ne E, schistosomiasis, ne typhoid fever; Endwadde nnyingi ezisibuka mu vector (e.g."

"Accordingly, the concentration of disinfectant in the wastewater can be high.","Okusinziira ku kino, ekirungo ekitta obuwuka mu mazzi amakyafu kiyinza okuba waggulu."
"Collection of Liquid healthcare Waste Segregation, minimization and safe storage of hazardous materials are just as important for liquid wastes as they are for solid wastes.","Okukunganya okwawula kasasiro w’ebyobulamu ow’amazzi, okukendeeza n’okutereka ebintu eby’obulabe mu ngeri ey’obukuumi bikulu nnyo eri kasasiro ow’amazzi nga bwe kiri ku kasasiro omukalu."
The two traditional collection arrangements are: Central system of sewage pipes bringing wastewater from throughout the facility to a central underground location for treatment or disposal; and De-centralized system wherein pipes from some medical areas pass wastewater to septic tanks or cesspits.,Enteekateeka ebbiri ez’ennono ez’okukung’aanya ze zino: enkola ey’omu makkati ey’emidumu gy’amazzi amakyafu nga gireeta amazzi amakyafu okuva mu kifo kyonna mu kifo ekiri wakati w’ettaka wakati okulongoosebwa oba okusuula; ne de-centralized system nga payipu okuva mu bitundu ebimu eby’obujjanjabi ziyita amazzi amakyafu okutuuka ku septic tanks oba cesspits.
"A centralized collection and treatment system is the preferred and recommended approach for management of wastewater for health-care facilities especially in regional referral The recommended set-up for management of wastewater from healthcare facilities includes: Construction of two separate collection systems Sewerage system for wastewater (sanitary sewers) Stormwater system for rainwater (stormwater sewers), which can be used for gardens, toilet flushing or washing of paved areas Manholes to allow access for maintenance every 50 meters or less Watertight sewerage pipes and manholes Pre-treatment to reduce or eliminate contaminants in non-domestic wastewater, or in altering its nature before discharging it into the sewer.","Enkola ey’okukung’aanya n’okulongoosa mu makkati y’enkola esinga okwettanirwa era esengekeddwa okuddukanya amazzi amakyafu eri ebifo eby’obulamu naddala mu kitundu ekiweereddwayo enteekateeka esengekeddwa okuddukanya amazzi amakyafu okuva mu bifo eby’obulamu mulimu: okuzimba enkola bbiri ez’enjawulo ez’okukung’aanya emyala enkola y’amazzi amakyafu (amadirisa g’omu ttaka) enkola y’amazzi g’enkuba ag’okunaabiramu amazzi agava mu bitundu by’emyala 1 Payipu z’emyala ezitayingiramu mazzi n’ebifo ebiyingira mu mazzi nga tebinnaba kulongoosebwa okukendeeza oba okumalawo obucaafu mu mazzi amakyafu agatali ga wano, oba mu kukyusa obutonde bwago nga tonnagafulumya mu myala."

"The preferred method is to connect the healthcare sewage system to the municipal sewage system and to discharge healthcare wastewater after adequate pretreatment to municipal sewage if the municipal sewage treatment plant meets the following minimum requirements: Use of primary, secondary and tertiary treatment; Removal of >95% of bacteria; Treatment of sewage sludge to destroy helminth eggs to < 1 egg per liter; Compliance with local regulatory requirements.","Enkola esinga okwettanirwa kwe kuyungako enkola y’amazzi amakyafu ku nkola y’amazzi amakyafu mu munisipaali n’okufulumya amazzi amakyafu mu by’obulamu oluvannyuma lw’okusooka okulongoosebwa nga tebannaba kulongoosa munisipaali singa ekyuma ekirongoosa amazzi amakyafu ekya munisipaali kituukiriza ebisaanyizo bino wammanga ebitonotono: okukozesa enkola ya pulayimale, ey’okubiri n’ey’okusatu; okuggyawo >95% ku bakitiriya; okujjanjaba amazzi amakyafu okusaanyaawo amagi ga helminth okutuuka ku < 1 eggi buli liita; Okugoberera ebisaanyizo by’okulungamya eby’omu kitundu."
"If no municipal sewage system exists, or If the municipal sewage system does not meet basic requirements, or If the area experiences epidemics of enteric diseases or endemic intestinal helminthiasis, the recommended option is on-site wastewater treatment.","Singa tewali nkola ya munisipaali ya kazambi eriwo, oba singa enkola ya munisipaali efulumya amazzi amakyafu tetuukana na bisaanyizo bikulu, oba singa ekitundu kifuna obulwadde bw’endwadde z’omu lubuto oba obulwadde bw’ekyenda ekisangibwa mu kitundu kino, eky’okulonda ekisemba kwe kulongoosa amazzi amakyafu mu kifo."

"Lagooning system In a region or an individual health-care facility that cannot afford sophisticated sewage-treatment plants, and where infiltration of the wastewater is not possible, a Lagooning system is a basic solution for treating wastewater, if enough land is available ( divided in facultative lagoons (oxygen is supplied primarily by algae) and aerated lagoons (oxygen is supplied by mechanical surface aeration).","Lagooning system mu kitundu oba ekifo ky’ebyobulamu kinnoomu ekitasobola kwesasulira bikolero bya mazzi amakyafu ebisobola okukolebwa, era nga okuyingira kw’amazzi amakyafu tekusoboka, enkola y’okukola lagoooni kye kigonjoola ekikulu eky’okulongoosa amazzi amakyafu, singa ettaka erimala libeerawo ( nga egabanyiziddwa mu lagooni ezifa (oxygen) ewereddwa okusinga nga ziweebwa ebiwuka ebiyitibwa algae) era nga zigabanyizibwamu ettaka eriweweeza ku ngulu (oxygen) ewereddwa okusinga okugabibwa mu ngulu)."
"Mechanical aeration requires comparatively high operational costs (electricity); therefore, facultative lagoons are preferred.","Okufuuwa empewo mu byuma kyetaagisa ssente nnyingi nnyo ezisaasaanyizibwa mu kukola (amasannyalaze); N’olwekyo, lagoons facultative ze zisinga okwettanirwa."
"In the water column, the biodegradable organic materials held in suspension are degraded aerobically.","Mu mpagi y’amazzi, ebirungo ebiramu ebiyinza okuvunda ebikwatibwa mu kuyimirizibwa bivunda mu bbanga."
The oxygen required for aerobic decomposition is supplied by bacteria.,Oxygen eyeetaagisa okuvunda kw’omukka (aerobic decomposition) aweebwa obuwuka.
"Facultative lagoons can have the disadvantages of potentially generating pungent odours, variable effluent quality and a need for a large land surface area.","Falultative lagoons zisobola okuba n’ebizibu by’okuleeta akawoowo akawunya, omutindo gw’amazzi amakyafu ogukyukakyuka n’obwetaavu bw’ekitundu ekinene eky’ettaka."

"The starting point for developing a successful wastewater system is a wastewater audit, which would identify the expected wastewater streams from each medical and service area of the health-care facility, and provide data for pre-treatment, collection and treatment arrangements for wastewater to be developed.","Entandikwa y’okukola enkola y’amazzi amakyafu mu ngeri ennungi kwe kubala amazzi amakyafu, nga kino kyandizudde emigga egy’amazzi amakyafu egisuubirwa okuva mu buli kitundu ky’obujjanjabi n’okuweereza eky’ekifo eky’okulabirira ebyobulamu, n’okuwa ebikwata ku nteekateeka z’okulongoosa amazzi amakyafu nga tebannaba kujjanjabwa, okukung’aanya n’okulongoosa."
A maintenance plan to cover both corrective and preventive maintenance should also be prepared.,Enteekateeka y’okuddaabiriza okubikka ku ndabirira y’okutereeza n’okuziyiza nayo erina okutegekebwa.
An often-underestimated aspect in wastewater management is the loss of wastewater during collection and transport.,Ekintu ekitera okutegeerekeka obulungi mu kuddukanya amazzi amakyafu kwe kufiirwa amazzi amakyafu mu kiseera ky’okukung’aanya n’okutambuza.
"Losses of 1030% of the wastewater due to broken sewer pipes, nonwatertight access holes and leakages at pipe connections are common.","Okufiirwa kwa 1030% ku mazzi amakyafu olw’emyala egyamenyeka, ebituli ebiyingira mu mazzi ebitali bya mazzi n’okukulukuta ku biyungo bya payipu bitera okubaawo."
Installing a flow meter at the discharge point of the health-care facility is recommended for accurate monitoring.,Okuteeka mita y’amazzi agakulukuta mu kifo we bafulumya amazzi mu kifo awajjanjabirwa obulamu kirungi okulondoola okutuufu.
Maintenance and leakage problems can often be identified through regular (daily or weekly) comparison of water consumption and discharged wastewater quantities.,Ebizibu by’okuddaabiriza n’okukulukuta bitera okuzuulibwa nga tuyita mu kugeraageranya buli kiseera (buli lunaku oba buli wiiki) ku mazzi agakozesebwa n’obungi bw’amazzi amakyafu agafuluma.
The most common parameters for monitoring the effluent quality are: BOD5 (a test to estimate the amount of oxygen consumed by biochemical oxidation of waste contaminants in a five-day period at 20C);,Ebipimo ebisinga okumanyibwa okulondoola omutindo gw’amazzi amakyafu bye bino: BOD5 (okugezesa okubalirira obungi bwa okisigyeni akozesebwa mu kuziyiza obuwuka obucaafu mu biramu mu bbanga ery’ennaku ttaano ku 20C);
"If an onsite treatment plant is operated, the inflow of wastewater and the out flowing treated effluent should be tested regularly to monitor how efficiently the treatment plant reduces the concentration of contaminants.","Singa ekyuma ekirongoosa mu kifo kikolebwa, amazzi amakyafu agayingira n’amazzi agakulukuta agakulukuta agakulukuta galina okukeberebwa buli kiseera okulondoola engeri ekyuma ekirongoosa gye kikendeeza ku bungi bw’obucaafu."
This is because there is an important link between cleaning of health care facilities and persistence of nosocomial pathogens.,Kino kiri bwe kityo kubanga waliwo akakwate akakulu wakati w’okuyonja ebifo eby’obulamu n’okusigala nga biwuka ebirwaza mu ngeri ey’ekinnansi.
"The purpose of cleaning the environment is to remove visible dirt, reduce the level of microorganisms and to minimize the dissemination of infectious agents in the facility, thereby providing an aesthetically pleasing, sanitary and relatively contamination free environment for patients, staff and visitors.","Ekigendererwa ky’okuyonja obutonde bw’ensi kwe kuggyawo obucaafu obulabika, okukendeeza ku mutindo gw’obuwuka obutonotono n’okukendeeza ku kubunyisa ebirungo ebisiiga mu kifo, bwe kityo ne kiwa obutonde bw’abalwadde, abakozi n’abagenyi n’abagenyi."
"These are dispersed during dry dusting, weeping or shaking patient bedding.","Zino zisaasaanyizibwa mu kiseera ky’okukala enfuufu, okukaaba oba okukankanya ebitanda by’omulwadde."
"Thorough cleaning will remove 90% of microorganisms; therefore, it has to be done in standardized manner to avoid spreading of contamination.","Okwoza obulungi kijja kuggyawo ebitundu 90% ku buwuka obutonotono; N’olwekyo, kirina okukolebwa mu ngeri ey’omutindo okwewala okusaasaanya obucaafu."
Environmental Cleaning Program An environmental cleaning program is a structured set of elements or interventions which facilitate implementation of environmental cleaning at a healthcare facility.,Enteekateeka y’okuyonja obutonde Enteekateeka y’okuyonja obutonde bw’ensi ye nteekateeka etegekeddwa oba okuyingira mu nsonga eziyamba okussa mu nkola okuyonja obutonde mu kifo eky’ebyobulamu.

Soiled linen bags can be laundered with the soiled linen they contained.,Ensawo za bafuta ezicaafu zisobola okwozebwa ne bafuta encaafu gye balimu.
"Effectiveness of the laundering process depends on many factors, including: Water quality (p. H, hardness) Model/availability of commercial washers and dryers Always use and maintain laundry equipment according to manufacturers Always launder soiled linens from patient care areas in a designated area, which should: Be a dedicated space for performing laundering of soiled linen; Not contain any food, beverage or personal items; Have floors and walls made of durable materials that can withstand the exposures of the area (e.g., large quantities of water and steam); Have a separation between the soiled linen and clean linen storage areas, and ideally should be at negative pressure relative to other areas; Have hand washing facilities; Have SOPs and other job aids to assist laundry staff with procedures.","Obulung’amu bw’enkola y’okukukusa abantu businziira ku bintu bingi, omuli: omutindo gw’amazzi (p.

"For effective management of vectors and vermin that are harmful and impact adversely on the health care facilities, health care activities and spread of diseases and infections.","Okusobola okuddukanya obulungi ebiwuka n‟ebiwuka ebirina obulabe era nga bikwata ku bifo eby‟obulamu, emirimu gy‟obujjanjabi n‟okusaasaana kw‟endwadde n‟endwadde."
Vectors and Vermin Regular visual inspection of health care facilities in search of signs of presence of vectors and vermin should be incorporated into the routine maintenance protocols.,Vectors and vermin regular visual inspection of health care facilities in search of signs of okubeerawo kwa vectors ne vermin kulina okuyingizibwa mu nkola ya bulijjo ey’okuddaabiriza.
"The following types of vectors and vermin are most common at the health care facilities and their presence can be detected by citing damage caused, alive or dead individuals, droppings and smells: Mammals: Bats are among the most commonly cited vermin in the health care facilities.","Ebika by’ebiwuka n’ebiwuka bino wammanga bisinga kubeera mu bifo eby’obulamu era okubeerawo kwabyo osobola okukizuula nga tujuliza okwonooneka olw’abantu ssekinnoomu abalamu oba abafu, okusuula n’okuwunya: Ebinyonyi ebiyonka: Enkwale ze zimu ku zisinga okujulizibwa mu bifo eby’obulamu."
"Apart from posing risk of zoonotic diseases, they pollute the air by causing a foul smell Rodents: Rats are the commonly cited rodents in the health care facilities.","Ng’oggyeeko okuleeta endwadde z’ebisolo, zicaafuwaza empewo nga zireeta ebiwuka ebiwunya obubi: envunza ze zitera okujulizibwa mu bifo eby’obulamu."
"Problems caused by rats include; damage to equipment and personal properties as they prepare for nesting, nibbling on food stuffs resulting into waste as the food is disposed of, and introducing vectors like fleas.","Ebizibu ebiva ku nvunza mulimu; Okwonoonebwa kw’ebikozesebwa n’ebintu by’omuntu nga bwe beetegekera okuzimba ebisu, okunyiga ku bintu by’emmere ebivaamu kasasiro ng’emmere esuulibwa, n’okuleeta ebiwuka ebiziyiza endwadde nga ensekere."
Reptiles: These may include snakes.,Ebisolo ebikulukusiza ku ttaka: Mu bino biyinza okubaamu emisota.
"Although many snake species are not poisonous, seeing one particularly indoors may cause nervousness, stress or stampede.","Wadde ng’ebika by’emisota bingi si bya butwa, okulaba ekimu naddala mu nnyumba kiyinza okuleeta okutya, situleesi oba situleesi."
Insects are the most successful class of the animal kingdom and are thus difficult to control.,Ebiwuka bye bisinga okukola obulungi mu bwakabaka bw’ebisolo era bwe bityo bizibu okufuga.
Birds: Birds that nest inside houses are not aggressive to humans but cause foul smells from the debris they collect in their nests.,Ebinyonyi: Ebinyonyi ebisubwa munda mu mayumba si bya bukambwe eri abantu wabula bireeta obuwoowo obuvundu okuva mu bifunfugu bye bikung’aanya mu bisu byabwe.
The debris and birds themselves could harbor mites which can cause allergic reactions in some people.,Ebifunfugu n’ebinyonyi byennyini bisobola okukuuma enkwaso ekiyinza okuleeta alergy mu bantu abamu.
"The following methods of controlling vectors and vermin may be employed: Architectural and Engineering Designs Considerations Ventilators of ceilings and similar openings should be fitted with netting material to block access of rats, bats and birds into the ceiling from the outside environment; Avoid dead spaces and crevices between walls and furniture (cabinets, wardrobes, etc.)","Enkola zino wammanga ez’okufuga vectors ne vermin ziyinza okukozesebwa: architectural and engineering designs considerations ventilators of ceilings and similar openings zirina okuteekebwa n’ebintu ebiteekebwamu akatimba okuziyiza okuyingira kw’envunza, enkwale n’ebinyonyi mu ceiling okuva mu mbeera ey’ebweru; Weewale ebifo ebifu n’enjatika wakati wa bbugwe n’ebintu by’omu nnyumba (kabineti, woduloomu, n’ebirala)"
They also gather dust because they are difficult to clean and ultimately attract various insects.,Era zikung’aanya enfuufu kubanga zikaluba okuyonja era okukkakkana nga zisikiriza ebiwuka eby’enjawulo.
"The dust may also cause allergies to people; Use well-fitting window screens to eliminate entry for insects, birds and bats; In areas with heavy infestations of termites, use of metallic installations should be considered over wooden ones.","Enfuufu era eyinza okuleeta alergy eri abantu; kozesa screens z’amadirisa ezikwata obulungi okumalawo okuyingira kw’ebiwuka, ebinyonyi n’enkima; Mu bitundu ebirimu ebiwuka ebizito eby’ensiri, okukozesa ebyuma ebiteekebwamu ebyuma kulina okulowoozebwako ku mbaawo."
Fumigation and application of pesticides and insecticides Chemical methods of prevention and control of vectors and vermin are very effective but they are not environmentally friendly.,Okufuyira n’okukozesa eddagala n’eddagala ly’ebiwuka Enkola z’eddagala ez’okuziyiza n’okufuga ebiwuka n’ebiwuka zikola nnyo naye tezirina butonde bwa butonde.
Fumigation employs use of highly poisonous gases which may leak into the surrounding environment beyond the health care facility.,Okufuyira kukozesa okukozesa ggaasi ez’obutwa ennyo eziyinza okukulukuta mu mbeera eyeetoolodde okusukka ekifo ky’ebyobulamu.
"Therefore, skilled personnel should be hired to conduct the fumigation exercises.","N’olwekyo, abakozi abakugu balina okupangisibwa okukola dduyiro w’okufuyira."
Fumigation may be done once or twice a year depending on the levels of infestation and type of vectors involved.,Okufuyira kuyinza okukolebwa omulundi gumu oba ebiri omwaka okusinziira ku mitendera gy’okulumbibwa n’ekika kya vectors ekizingirwamu.
Advice of a skilled fumigator should be sought on the frequency of fumigation.,Amagezi g’omukugu mu kufumba fumigator galina okunoonyezebwa ku mirundi gy’okufuyira.
It should be noted that over fumigation may lead to chemical resistance developing in the vector population.,Kinajjukirwa nti okufuyira okusukka ku fumigation kuyinza okuvaako okuziyiza eddagala okukulaakulana mu kibinja ky’ebiwuka ebiziyiza endwadde.
"In as far as possible, poisons specific to a particular species should be used; Use of repellants.","Mu ngeri gye kisoboka, obutwa obukwata ku kika ekimu bulina okukozesebwa; Okukozesa eddagala erigoba abantu."
Napthalene is effective for many vectors but use of repellants in general is discouraged because people who spend long periods in rooms where the repellants are applied get exposed by inhaling the chemical fumes.,Napthalene ekola bulungi ku vector nnyingi naye okukozesa eddagala erigoba abantu okutwalira awamu kuggwaamu amaanyi kubanga abantu abamala ebbanga eddene mu bisenge ebigoba ebigobererwa bafuna okubikkulwa nga bassa omukka gw’eddagala.
Use of repellants should be limited to rooms that are not permanently occupied;,Okukozesa eddagala erigoba omuntu ku ttaka kulina okukoma ku bisenge ebitawambibwa enkalakkalira;
Insecticides/pesticides can be used to treat small local infestations and to prevent build-up of populations.,Eddagala/eddagala eritta ebiwuka liyinza okukozesebwa okujjanjaba obuwuka obutono obuyingira mu kitundu n’okuziyiza okuzimba abantu.
Pyrethrins are recommended because they are not very toxic to people and do not persist in the environment; Desiccant dusts are put in cabinets where insects are known to occur.,Pyrethrins zisemba kubanga tezirina butwa bungi eri abantu era tezinywerera mu butonde; Enfuufu ezikala ziteekebwa mu kabineti awali ebiwuka ebimanyiddwa nti bibaawo.
Strategically placed traps can be used to capture or monitor presence of adult vectors and vermin.,Emitego egyateekebwa mu ngeri ey’obukodyo giyinza okukozesebwa okukwata oba okulondoola okubeerawo kw’ebiwuka ebikulu ebitambuza obuwuka n’ebiwuka.
"Landscaping and Gardening Outdoor environments that are attractive and appealing address the emotional and psychological needs of patients, care takers and staff.","Okulabirira ettaka n’okulima ensuku embeera ez’ebweru ezisikiriza era ezisikiriza zikola ku byetaago by’abalwadde mu nneewulira n’eby’omwoyo, abalabirira n’abakozi."
"There is growing scientific evidence that viewing gardens can reduce stress in patients and treats the anxiety that may accompany illness, thus generally improving the health outcomes.","Waliwo obukakafu bwa ssaayansi obugenda bweyongera nti okulaba ensuku kiyinza okukendeeza ku situleesi mu balwadde n’okujjanjaba okweraliikirira okuyinza okuwerekera obulwadde, bwe kityo okutwalira awamu okulongoosa ebiva mu bulamu."
"While designs of HCFs tend to focus on reducing risks of infections, emphasis should also be put on creating environments that have pleasant and stress reducing characteristics.","Wadde nga dizayini za HCFs zitera okussa essira ku kukendeeza ku bulabe bw’okukwatibwa endwadde, essira era lirina okuteekebwa ku kutondawo embeera ezirina engeri ezisanyusa era ezikendeeza ku situleesi."
"Landscape and gardening features With regard to the general topography of the area, landscape designs may require modifying the contours before construction of structures and creation of gardens.","Ebifaananyi by’enkula y’ensi n’ensuku Ku bikwata ku nkula y’ensi ey’awamu ey’ekitundu, dizayini z’ebifo ziyinza okwetaagisa okukyusa enkula y’ebintu nga tebannaba kuzimba bizimbe n’okutonda ensuku."
The general principle that should be put into consideration while preparing landscape designs is site safety.,Omusingi ogw’awamu ogulina okuteekebwa mu nkola nga okuteekateeka dizayini z’ebifo (landscape designs) kwe kukuuma ekifo.
The outdoor environment should not in any way endanger the lives of people.,Embeera y’ebweru mu ngeri yonna tesaana kuteeka bulamu bwa bantu mu matigga.
Site safety may be linked to several other principles detailed below.,Obukuumi bw’ekifo buyinza okuyungibwa ku misingi emirala egiwerako egyogeddwako wansi.
Appropriate plants should be chosen for the different areas that are included in the landscape design following these as general principles; Avoid growing poisonous plants even when they add beauty to the landscape.,Ebimera ebituufu birina okulondebwa ku bitundu eby’enjawulo ebiteekebwa mu nteekateeka y’enkula y’ensi nga bigoberera bino ng’emisingi egy’awamu; Weewale okulima ebimera eby’obutwa ne bwe biba byongera obulungi ku kifo.
Consultations should be made with botanists for advice.,Okwebuuza ku bantu kulina okukolebwa n’abakugu mu by’ebimera okusobola okubuulirirwa.
"For example, some ornamental plants belonging to the Araceae family, like Syngonium sp ( Many invasive plant species are ornamental yet they pose harmful effects to the ecosystems.","Okugeza, ebimera ebimu eby’okwewunda ebibeera mu kika kya Araceae, nga Syngonium SP ( ebika by’ebimera bingi ebiyingira mu nsi bibeera bya kwewunda naye nga bikola obulabe eri ensengekera z’obutonde."
These must be avoided and advice of specialists should be sought.,Bino birina okwewalibwa era amagezi g’abakugu galina okunoonyezebwa.
"For these landscapes: A warm and welcoming effect should be created at the entrance using colourful flowers, ornamental shrubs and trees that exhibit various effects of shape and size; The therapeutic effects of plants help to calm down patients and reduce anxiety.","Ku bifo bino: ekikolwa eky’ebbugumu era eky’okusembeza kisaana okutondebwawo ku mulyango oguyingira nga tukozesa ebimuli ebya langi, ebisaka eby’okwewunda n’emiti ebiraga ebikolwa eby’enjawulo eby’ekikula n’obunene; Ebikosa ebimera biyamba okukkakkanya abalwadde n’okukendeeza okweraliikirira."
The floor where tents are used should be paved to avoid the dusty bare grounds that form as a result of over trampling.,Wansi weema we zikozesebwa zirina okukolebwako kkoolaasi okwewala ebibangirizi eby’obwereere ebitaliimu nfuufu ebiva mu kulinnyirira okusukkiridde.
"Dust can harbour vectors like flees; View of the outdoor environment should be made possible by locating windows such that patients who are unable to move out can also experience the beauty and calm that is created by the beautiful gardens; Trees should not be so much isolated from the buildings because they give a cooling effect onto the houses during the hot seasons, yet they should not be too close or too many as they may cause the interior to feel chilly.","Enfuufu esobola okubeera n’ebintu ebiva mu bifo eby’enjawulo ng’okubuuka; Okulabira ku mbeera y’ebweru kulina okusoboka nga tuzuula amadirisa nga abalwadde abatasobola kusenguka nabo basobola okulaba obulungi n’obukkakkamu obutondebwawo ensuku ennungi; Emiti tegisaanidde kwekutula nnyo ku bizimbe kubanga giwa ekikolwa eky’okunyogoza ku mayumba mu biseera eby’ebbugumu, naye nga tegirina kubeera kumpi nnyo oba bingi kuba giyinza okuva munda okuwulira nga nnyogovu."
Trees that are too close to buildings can cause damage to the building by the roots cracking the foundation and walls; Crevices that develop on the building along verandas or in the walls should be repaired immediately because the crevices could form hiding places for vectors and vermin.,Emiti egy’okumpi ennyo n’ebizimbe giyinza okwonoona ekizimbe olw’ebikoola ebikutula omusingi ne bbugwe; Enjatika ezikulaakulana ku kizimbe ku mabbali g’ennamba oba mu bbugwe zirina okuddaabirizibwa amangu ddala kubanga ebituli bisobola okukola ebifo we beekukumamu ebiwuka ebiyitibwa vectors ne vermin.
"The crevices can also accumulate soil, giving a good substrate for plants to grow.","Enjatika zino era zisobola okukung’aanya ettaka, ne ziwa ebimera ebirungi ebimera okukula."
Lawns should be kept meticulously clean and with short grass.,Omuddo gulina okukuumibwa mu ngeri ey’obwegendereza era nga gulimu omuddo omumpi.
These may accelerate recovery through psychological feeling of body renewal.,Bino biyinza okwanguya okuwona nga biyita mu kuwulira kw’omubiri okw’okuzza obuggya omubiri.
Both private and group seating should be availed.,Entuula zombi ez’obwannannyini n’ez’ekibinja zirina okukozesebwa.
Group seats encourage human interaction but can also be a source of infection.,Ebitebe by’ekibinja bikubiriza abantu okukwatagana naye era bisobola okuba ensibuko y’obulwadde.
Patients with infectious diseases should be advised to isolate by taking the Childrens play areas.,Abalwadde abalina endwadde ezisiigibwa balina okubuulirirwa okweyawula nga batwala ebifo by’abaana we bazannyira.
Recuperating and visiting children may want to be active.,Abaana abadda engulu n’abakyalira bayinza okwagala okubeera abanyiikivu.
Play areas should offer a wide assortment of items and activities.,Ebifo eby’okuzannyiramu birina okuwa ebintu n’emirimu egy’enjawulo.
The ground in these areas should be safe; either with sand or a grass species that will withstand trampling.,Ettaka mu bitundu bino lirina okuba nga teririna bulabe; Oba n’omusenyu oba ekika ky’omuddo ekijja okugumira okulinnyirira.

"The following principles should be followed when planting trees/shrubs: The species of trees/shrubs chosen should not be the types favoured by animals that are locally considered as vermin/vectors; Locally used medicinal plants that dont require harvesting by debarking or uprooting may be considered for planting; Ornamental fruit plants may also be planted because they could supplement diets of Ornamental trees/shrubs should be positioned so that they are visible from inside too; Shade trees should be planted and the areas designated as resting places, fitted with 10.6.2.3.","Emisingi gino wammanga girina okugobererwa nga tusimba emiti/ebisaka: ebika by’emiti/ebisaka ebirondeddwa tebirina kuba bika bisinga kwagala bisolo ebitwalibwa mu kitundu nga ebiwuka/ebiwuka ebiyitibwa vermin/vectors; Ebimera eby’eddagala ebikozesebwa mu kitundu ekyo ebitaali byetaaga kukungula nga bikutula oba okusimbula biyinza okulowoozebwako okusimba; Ebimera by’ebibala eby’okwewunda nabyo biyinza okusimbibwa kubanga bisobola okugatta ku mmere y’emiti/ebisusunku eby’okwewunda birina okuteekebwa mu kifo bisobole okulabika okuva munda nabyo; Emiti egy’ebisiikirize girina okusimbibwa era ebitundu ebiragiddwa ng’ebifo ebiwummuzibwamu, ebiteekeddwako 10.6.2.3."
Driveways and Parking Spaces These should be safe and clean.,Ebifo ebiyingira mu mmotoka n’ebifo we basimbye mmotoka bino birina okuba nga tebirina bulabe era nga biyonjo.
Specific principles should include:,Emisingi egy’enjawulo girina okubeeramu:
They should be fitted with clearly visible signs for directions.,Zirina okuteekebwako obubonero obulabika obulungi okusobola okulaba endagiriro.
"The signposts should be large and easy to see from a reasonable distance, standing at a height of five to six feet (eye level for average height persons), with contrasting background and word colours (e.g.","Ebipande birina okuba ebinene era nga byangu okulaba okuva mu bbanga erisaanira, nga biyimiridde ku buwanvu bwa ffuuti ttaano ku mukaaga (eye level for average height persons), nga waliwo langi ez’enjawulo ez’emabega n’ebigambo (e.g."
Choice of colour of signage should not blend with the background vegetation or buildings but instead contrast with it for easy siting.,Okulonda langi y’ebipande tekulina kwegatta na bimera eby’emabega oba ebizimbe wabula mu kifo ky’ekyo kwawukana nagwo olw’okutuula okwangu.
"Trees that drop heavy parts like large palm leaves, fruits or branches are potentially dangerous and shouldnt be planted along driveways and parking spaces; Regular monitoring of the surfaces should be observed to ensure that they are always levelled.","Emiti egisuula ebitundu ebizito ng’ebikoola by’enkindu ebinene, ebibala oba amatabi giyinza okuba egy’obulabe era nga giteekeddwa okusimbibwa mu bifo ebiyingira mu mmotoka n’ebifo we basimbye mmotoka; Okulondoola buli kiseera ku ngulu kulina okutunuulirwa okukakasa nti bulijjo zibeera zitereevu."
Potholes should be filled up and protruding parts should be levelled.,Ebinnya birina okujjula era ebitundu ebifuluma birina okuleetebwa.
"The signpost is not obstructed by surrounding vegetation, and is written in large dark-coloured words on a white background.","Ekipande kino tekiremesebwa bimera ebikyetoolodde, era kiwandiikibwa mu bigambo ebinene ebya langi enzirugavu ku mugongo omweru."
Specific principles that would guide designing walkways should include: Surfaces need to be paved.,Emisingi egy’enjawulo egyandibadde gilungamya okudizayina amakubo g’okutambuliramu girina okubeeramu: ebifo eby’okungulu byetaaga okuteekebwako kkoolaasi.
"The surfaces should be smooth but slip proof, with nothing to cause tripping; there should be regular monitoring for presence of sunken or protruding pavers and these should be attended to as soon as they are discovered.","Ebifo eby’okungulu birina okuba nga biweweevu naye nga biseerera, nga tewali kivaako kugwa; Wabeewo okulondoola buli kiseera okulaba oba waliwo pavers ezibbira oba ezifuluma era zino zirina okutwalibwa mu bwangu nga zizuuliddwa."
"When used, ornamental bushes lining the walkways should be far enough to avoid clinging of clothing, wheel chairs, etc.","Bwe zikozesebwa, ebisaka eby’okwewunda ebigenda mu bifo ebitambulirwamu birina okuba ewala ekimala okwewala okunywerera ku ngoye, entebe z’abalema n’ebirala."
Hand rails need to be installed where the gradient is high.,Eggaali z’omukka ez’omu ngalo zeetaaga okuteekebwako awali ekisenge ekiwanvu (gradient) waggulu.
Storm Water Drainage Stormwater drainage systems should be designed in accordance with the approved national engineering standards to adequately and safely convey the stormwater flowing on the HCFs premises to avoid flooding and nuisance of deposits carried by the stormwater.,Amazzi g’enkuba agafulumya amazzi g’enkuba Enkola z’amazzi g’enkuba zirina okukolebwa okusinziira ku mutindo gwa yinginiya w’eggwanga ogukkirizibwa okusobola okutambuza obulungi amazzi g’enkuba agakulukuta mu kifo kya HCFS okwewala okubooga n’okutaataaganyizibwa kw’ebifo ebiterekeddwa amazzi g’enkuba.

Where there is freedom of choice then factors like financing (development and maintenance) should be considered.,Awali eddembe ery’okulonda olwo ensonga nga ensimbi (okukulaakulanya n’okulabirira) zirina okulowoozebwako.
"Live fences have the advantage of contributing to cleaning up the environment through air purification and dust control, and the main disadvantage of requiring regular maintenance which may be costly.","Ebikomera ebiramu birina enkizo ey’okuyamba mu kuyonja obutonde bw’ensi nga biyita mu kulongoosa empewo n’okufuga enfuufu, n’obuzibu obukulu obw’okwetaaga okuddaabiriza buli kiseera ekiyinza okuba eky’ebbeeyi."
"Wall fences, barbed wire and chain links may be expensive to install but require less frequent maintenance and are therefore cheaper to maintain in the long run.","Ebikomera ku bbugwe, waya z’emisumaali n’enjegere biyinza okuba eby’ebbeeyi okuteeka naye nga byetaaga okuddaabiriza okutali kwa bulijjo n’olwekyo biba bya buseere okulabirira mu bbanga eggwanvu."
"Various combinations of fence types may be used depending on the special needs of the facility, for example, a live fence enforced with chain link or barbed wire is recommended in areas where domestic animals seek grazing or resting places within the facility premises.","Ebika by’olukomera eby’enjawulo bisobola okukozesebwa okusinziira ku byetaago eby’enjawulo eby’ekifo, okugeza, olukomera olulamu olukakasiddwa n’enjegere eziyunga oba waya z’emiguwa zisemba mu bitundu ebisolo by’awaka we binoonya ebifo eby’okulunda oba okuwummulira mu kifo ky’ekifo."
It is critical that all WASH facilities are kept fully operational and clean to reduce transmission of diseases.,Kikulu nnyo nti ebifo byonna eby’okunaaba bikuumibwa nga bikola mu bujjuvu era nga biyonjo okukendeeza ku kutambuza endwadde.
"Poorly maintained or unclean facilities will deter people from using them, and can become an epicentre in transmitting various diseases.","Ebifo ebirabirirwa obubi oba ebitali biyonjo bijja kulemesa abantu okubikozesa, era bisobola okufuuka ekifo ekikulu mu kutambuza endwadde ez’enjawulo."
There is a need to ensure clear management arrangements and planning for costs and O&Mrequirements before installation For sustainability of effective WASH facilities at health care facilities.,Waliwo obwetaavu bw’okulaba ng’enteekateeka z’okuddukanya emirimu n’okuteekateeka ebisale n’ebisale bya O&Mreements tebinnaba kuteekebwawo okusobola okuyimirizaawo ebifo ebirungi eby’okunaabiramu mu bifo eby’obulamu.
The monthly or annual operating cost must be estimated so the management can budget accordingly.,Ensimbi ezisaasaanyizibwa buli mwezi oba buli mwaka zirina okubalirirwa kale abaddukanya basobola embalirira okusinziira ku ekyo.
"Costs may include the water supply, consumables (soap, cleaning products, PPE for cleaners etc), staff costs, monitoring, repairs and eventually replacement of the worn-out facilities.","Ebisale biyinza okuli amazzi, ebikozesebwa (SOAP, eby’okwoza, PPE for cleaners etc), ssente z’abakozi, okulondoola, okuddaabiriza n’okukkakkana nga bikyusiddwa ebifo ebikooye."
O&Mplanning and budgeting should be a key aspect under here as it is the starting point for the above listed activities.,O&MPANLING AND MAINTING WABANGA EKIKULU WA WANO WANO nga bwe kiri entandikwa y’emirimu egyo waggulu egyawandiikibwa.

"Pump Element As the pumping element is water lubricated, it should not require service.","Pump element Nga ekintu ekikuba amazzi bwe kisiigibwa amazzi, tekisaanye kwetaaga saaviisi."
"However, if service or replacements become necessary, the work can be carried out on the site without special tools Packed Glands The gland should be inspected and adjusted regularly to provide the correct lubrication with a slight leakage.","Naye singa service oba replacements zifuuka ezeetaagisa, omulimu gusobola okukolebwa ku kifo nga tewali bikozesebwa bya njawulo ebipakiddwa gland enseke erina okwekebejjebwa n’okutereezebwa buli kiseera okusobola okuwa okusiiga okutuufu nga kukulukuta okutono."
"The gland packing should be replaced approximately every  hours, or sooner if the gland shows signs of excessive leakage.","Okupakinga enseke kulina okukyusibwa nga buli ssaawa, oba amangu ddala singa enseke eraga obubonero bw’okukulukuta okuyitiridde."
Grease gland bolts and nuts at each inspection Bearings are rated for operation in excess of  hours.,Grease gland bolts and nuts ku buli bearings ez’okukebera ziweebwa ekipimo okukola okumala essaawa ezisukka mu.
"However, wear will occur quickly if bearings are allowed to operate without lubrication or under dirty conditions, or if overloaded due to excessive belt tension Open Cage Bearings Check every  hours.","Naye, okwambala kujja kubaawo mangu singa bbeeri zikkirizibwa okukola awatali kusiiga oba mu mbeera encaafu, oba singa ziyitirira olw’okusika omusipi okuyitiridde okukebera cage check buli ssaawa."
Sealed bearings require no attention Belt Tension Belt tension should be checked during gland inspections.,Siled bearings tekyetaagisa attention belt tension tension tension kulina okukeberebwa mu kiseera ky’okukebera gland.
"If belts need replacement, replace ALL belts with a matched set Column, Driveshaft, Bobbin Bearings Need for replacement of any worn or defective units will be obvious from visual inspection, but as withdrawal of column and driveshaft assemblies, and the pumping elements, requires time and effort it is wise always to replace any items which are suspect The pump stator is natural rubber moulded inside a metal tube, and should not be lubricated with any petroleum-based products (i.e., hand cleaner, grease etc.).","Singa emisipi gyetaaga okukyusibwa, zzaayo emisipi gyonna n’empagi etekeddwa ekwatagana, driveshaft, bobbials bearings zeetaaga okukyusa yuniti zonna ezikaze oba ezifudde zijja kweyoleka okuva mu kwekebejja okulaba, naye ng’okuggyayo empagi n’enkuŋŋaana za driveshaft, era ebintu ebipampagira, byetaaga obudde n’okufuba nga kya magezi bulijjo okukyusa ebintu byonna, nga biteeberezebwa okuba nga bikoleddwa mu ppampu ekoleddwa mu kibumba eky’obutonde munda mu kyuma, era nga kibeera kya magezi okukyusibwamu ebintu byonna ebiteeberezebwa okuba nga biteeberezebwa okuba nga bikoleddwa mu ppampu nga bikoleddwa mu kibumba eky’obutonde munda mu kyuma, era nga kiteekwa okukyusibwamu ekintu kyonna ekiteeberezebwa nti kikolebwa mu ppampu ekolebwa mu ttaapu ey’obutonde.

Approaches to HCF O&MThe HCF O&Mstrategy should largely be based on the preventative approach with limited room for corrective and reactive approaches.,Enkola ku HCF O&MThe HCF O&Mstrategy okusinga yandibadde esinziira ku nkola ey’okuziyiza nga erina ekifo ekitono eky’okutereeza n’okuddamu okukola.
"This approach extends the lifetime of WASH infrastructure, saves costs in the long-term and also reduces the frequency with which expensive reactive maintenance or emergency backup solutions are required (HARVEY 2015).","Enkola eno egaziya obulamu bw’ebintu eby’okunaaba, ekekkereza ssente mu bbanga eggwanvu era era ekendeeza ku mirundi okuddaabiriza okw’ebbeeyi okw’okuddamu oba okukola eby’okutereka eby’amangu okwetaagisa (Harvey 2015)."
"The approach requires that O&Mwork is planned, adequately scheduled and carried out on a regular basis to maintain and keep the WASH infrastructure in good condition.","Enkola esaba nti O&MWork etegekeddwa, etegekeddwa bulungi era ekolebwe buli kiseera okulabirira n’okukuuma ebikozesebwa mu kunaaba nga biri mu mbeera nnungi."
"The HCF periodically assesses WASH infrastructure replacing or repairing something that was done incorrectly or that needs to be changed: an example is the reallocation of a pipe route or replacement of a faulty pump, inappropriate taps at hand washing facilities in light of the COVID The HCF should develop a clear detailed O&Mcrisis response plan to adequately respond to a WASH crisis or client complaint due to failure and or malfunctioning or breakdown of WASH equipment.","The HCF periodically assesses WASH infrastructure replacing or repairing something that was done incorrectly or that needs to be changed: an example is the reallocation of a pipe route or replacement of a faulty pump, inappropriate taps at hand washing facilities in light of the COVID The HCF should develop a clear detailed O&Mcrisis response plan to adequately respond to a WASH crisis or client complaint due to failure and or malfunctioning or breakdown of WASH equipment."
This is best handled by flexibility to request for funds to locally procure spare parts and engage locally available skilled personnel to repair the malfunctioning system.,Kino kisinga kukwatibwa nga kikyukakyuka okusaba ssente okugula sipeeya mu kitundu n’okuyingiza abakozi abakugu abasangibwa mu kitundu okuddaabiriza enkola eno ekola obubi.
"HCFs should set up a WASH committee that bear the responsibility to plan, budget, monitor and maintain WASH facilities.","HCFS erina okuteekawo akakiiko k’eby’okwoza akalina obuvunaanyizibwa okuteekateeka, okukola embalirira, okulondoola n’okulabirira ebifo eby’okunaaba."
"Depending on the facility committee should consist of an in charge, supervisor(s), and attendant each with assigned responsibilities in relation to maintaining sanitation In order to properly plan for O&Mactivities and inspections, daily, monthly, quarterly and annual work plans should be developed along with a clear procedure for reporting gaps or problems with the WASH infrastructure.","Okusinziira ku kakiiko k’ebifo kalina okubaamu obuvunaanyizibwa, omulabirira, n’omutendesi buli omu alina obuvunaanyizibwa obuweereddwa ku bikwatagana n’okukuuma obuyonjo okusobola okuteekateeka obulungi enteekateeka z’emirimu n’okukebera O&Mactivities, buli lunaku, buli mwezi, buli luvannyuma lwa myezi esatu n’omwaka zirina okukolebwa wamu n’enkola entegeerekeka ey’okukola lipoota ku bbanga oba ebizibu ku nkola y’okunaaba."

"Where water is available from multiple sources, the main source should be recorded.","Amazzi we gali okuva mu nsonda eziwera, ensibuko enkulu erina okuwandiikibwa."
The recommended categories are based on JMP definitions of improved and unimproved water sources.,Ebika ebiteeseddwa byesigamiziddwa ku nnyonyola za JMP ez’ensonda z’amazzi ezirongooseddwa n’ezitalongooseddwa.
What is the main water supply for the facility?,Amazzi amakulu agaweebwa ekifo kino kye ki?
"If there is more than one source, the one used most frequently should be selected.","Singa wabaawo ensibuko ezisukka mu emu, eyo esinga okukozesebwa erina okulondebwa."
"If patients need to bring water from home because water is not available at the facility, no water source should be selected.","Singa abalwadde beetaaga okuleeta amazzi okuva awaka kubanga amazzi tegali mu kifo kino, tewali nsibuko ya mazzi erina kulondebwa."
"Question 1b asks about location of the water supply, in recognition of the fact that health care facilities need large volumes of water (for example 100 Lof water per delivery and 40-60 Lper inpatient per day) and therefore should have a water supply located on premises to be able to meet the demands of the facility.","Ekibuuzo 1B kibuuza ku kifo amazzi we gaweebwa, nga tumanyi nti ebifo eby’obulamu byetaaga amazzi amangi (okugeza amazzi 100 LOF buli kuzaala ne 40-60 lper mu ddwaaliro buli lunaku) n’olwekyo birina okuba n’amazzi agasangibwa ku kifo okusobola okutuukiriza ebyetaago by’ekifo."

Many guidelines have evidently been existent but implementation has been a very big challenge.,Kirabika ebiragiro bingi bibaddewo naye okussa mu nkola kubadde kusoomoozebwa kunene nnyo.
"Policy 1999, have been formulated to facilitate implementation of the WASH guidelines as intended.They neither replace the legal systems within the country nor the health sector but rather are meant to complement them.","Enkola 1999, zikoleddwa okusobola okwanguyiza okussa mu nkola enkola ya wash nga bwe kigendereddwamu.Tebakyusa nkola za mateeka mu ggwanga wadde ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu wabula zigendereddwamu okuzituukiriza."
"There is a need therefore, to specififcally look at all the pieces of legislation in regards to the technical teams and taskforces to ensure that duplicity of duties is taken care of as it appears frequently in the Public Health Act and PILS.","Waliwo obwetaavu n’olwekyo, okutunuulira mu ngeri ey’enjawulo ebitundu byonna eby’amateeka ku bikwata ku ttiimu z’ebyekikugu n’ebitongole ebikola emirimu okulaba ng’emirimu egy’emirundi ebiri gifaayo nga bwe gitera okulabika mu tteeka ly’ebyobulamu n’eby’obulamu."
"It is recommended that the enacting bodies of these taskforces all be bound into one so that the statutes are uniform, this will reduce on conflicts in regards to Accounting, managing of funds and supervision.","Kirungi nti ebitongole ebikola emirimu gino byonna bisibibwe mu kimu olwo amateeka gabeere gamu, kino kijja kukendeeza ku butakkaanya ku bikwata ku kubala ebitabo, okuddukanya ssente n’okulabirira."
This may require setting of rules with dos and donts and bye-laws as necessary with consequences of non-compliance.,Kino kiyinza okwetaagisa okuteekawo amateeka ne DOS ne donts ne bye-laws nga bwe kyetaagisa n’ebiva mu butagoberera mateeka.
"Article 2 - section 2 provides that the constitution is the supreme law of the land and any other law that is inconsistent with any of its provisions, the constitution shall prevail.","Akawaayiro 2 - Akawayiro 2 kalaga nti Ssemateeka lye tteeka ery’oku ntikko ery’ettaka n’etteeka eddala lyonna eritakwatagana na kiragiro kyayo kyonna, Ssemateeka y’anaafuga."

The literacy rate was higher for males (81%) than females (72%) in 2019/20.,Omuwendo gw’abantu abamanyi okusoma n’okuwandiika gwali mungi ku basajja (81%) okusinga abakazi (72%) mu mwaka gwa 2019/20.
It is through the key features of socioeconomic status of the country and its livelihood.,Kiyita mu bintu ebikulu ebikwata ku mbeera y’eby’enfuna n’embeera z’abantu mu ggwanga n’obulamu bwalyo.
"In addition, government has promoted participation of the private sector in the provision of education.","Okugatta ku ekyo, gavumenti etumbudde okwetaba kw’ebitongole by’obwannannyini mu kuwa ebyenjigiriza."

Most public schools are under threat by individuals who are mercilessly grabbing land that would serve the learning purpose better.,Amasomero ga gavumenti agasinga gali mu matigga abantu ssekinnoomu abakwata ettaka awatali kusaasira eryandiweerezza obulungi ekigendererwa ky’okuyiga.
"However, majority have failed to support the feeding of their children at schools.",Wabula abasinga obungi balemereddwa okuwagira okuliisa abaana baabwe ku masomero.
"Besides, the situation is worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and acute food shortages which have rendered communities helpless.","Ng’oggyeeko ekyo, embeera yeeyongedde okusajjuka olw’ebbula ly’emmere erya Covid-19 n’ebbula ly’emmere ery’amaanyi erifudde ebitundu obutaba na buyambi."

The sector continues to focus on access to drinking water as well as improved sanitation and sewerage services through increasing point water sources and piped water and sanitation coverage in both urban and rural areas targeting poor households especially those who are yet to be part of the money economy.,Ekitongole kino kikyagenda mu maaso n’okussa essira ku kufuna amazzi ag’okunywa wamu n’okulongoosa mu buyonjo n’okugula emyala nga bayita mu kwongera ku nsibuko z’amazzi aga point n’amazzi agakulukuta mu payipu n’obuyonjo mu bibuga n’ebyalo ebigenderera amaka amaavu naddala abo abatannaba kubeera kitundu ku by’enfuna bya ssente.

This framework builds on the strength of the current Community Based Management System (CBMS) model which has successfully contributed to achieving 85% functionality of rural water supply systems.,Enkola eno ezimba ku maanyi g’enkola ya Community Based Management System (CBMS) eriwo kati efunye obuwanguzi mu kutuuka ku nkola ya 85% ey’enkola z’amazzi g’omu byalo.
"However, there is need for an improved and professional approach to O&Mgiven that the natural sector target for O&Mis 95% as the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG); and looking into the future where higher technology restricts the CBMS model from being a viable approach The improved CBMS is referred to as Community Based Management System Plus (CBMS+).","Naye, waliwo obwetaavu bw’enkola erongooseddwa era ey’ekikugu ku O&MGIVen nti ekitongole ky’obutonde kigendererwamu O&MI 95% ng’ekiruubirirwa ky’enkulaakulana ey’olubeerera (SDG); Era okutunuulira ebiseera eby’omu maaso nga tekinologiya ow’ekika ekya waggulu aziyiza enkola ya CBMS okubeera enkola esoboka CBMS erongooseddwa kw’eyogerwako nga Community Based Management System Plus (CBMS+)."

This is evidenced by the inclusion of digital health as one of the priorities in the enabler for supporting better healthcare service delivery.,Kino kikakasibwa okussaamu ebyobulamu ebya digito ng’ekimu ku bikulu mu kisobozesa okuwagira okugaba empeereza y’ebyobulamu ennungi.
Health information systems have proved valuable in supporting patient care and improving population health outcomes by making data readily available for decision-making at all levels of the health sector.,Enkola z‟amawulire agakwata ku by‟obulamu zibadde za mugaso mu kuwagira okulabirira abalwadde n‟okulongoosa ebiva mu bulamu bw‟abantu nga zifuula data okwanguyirwa okusalawo ku mitendera gyonna egy‟ekitongole ky‟ebyobulamu.
"However, these health information systems are typically isolated within organisations.",Naye enkola zino ez’amawulire agakwata ku bulamu zitera okwawulwa mu bibiina.
"Ultimately, this fragmentation may prevent timely access to necessary information leading to duplication and delayed decision making hence the need for standardised and interoperable health information exchange (HIE).","Mu nkomerero, okukutukakutuka kuno kuyinza okutangira okufuna amawulire ageetaagisa mu budde ekivaako okuddiŋŋana n’okulwawo okusalawo n’olwekyo obwetaavu bw’okuwanyisiganya amawulire agakwata ku bulamu obulungi era agakwatagana (hie)."
HIE is the secure electronic transfer of health information among healthcare organisations using nationally recognised communication protocols and safety standards.,HIE ye nkola ey’obukuumi ey’okutambuza amawulire agakwata ku bulamu mu bibiina by’ebyobulamu nga bakozesa enkola z’empuliziganya ezimanyiddwa mu ggwanga n’omutindo gw’obukuumi.
"Therefore, there is a need to standardise HIE bearing in mind the known limitations and preconditions as well as provide guidance on best-known practices.","N’olwekyo, waliwo obwetaavu bw’okussa omutindo ku HIE ng’otunuulidde obuzibu obumanyiddwa n’obukwakkulizo obusookerwako awamu n’okuwa obulagirizi ku nkola ezisinga okumanyibwa."
"These are used to address a access clients information generated by different HIS and the possibility of progressively enriching the data at different locations whenever the clients interact with health systems across The goal of HIE is to facilitate the secure and seamless exchange of patient health information in a standardised format, ensuring that relevant and timely data is available.","Bino bikozesebwa okukola ku mawulire ga bakasitoma agatuuka ku bantu agakolebwa eby’enjawulo bye n’ebiyinza okugaggawaza amawulire mu bifo eby’enjawulo buli bakasitoma lwe bakolagana n’enkola z’ebyobulamu mu kiruubirirwa kya HIE kwe kwanguyiza okuwanyisiganya amawulire ag’obukuumi era agataliimu buzibu mu nkola ey’omutindo, okukakasa nti ebikwata ku nsonga eno ebikwatagana era ebituufu biriwo."
It is against this background that the Information Exchange and Interoperability.,"Kikontana n’embeera eno, okuwanyisiganya amawulire n’okukolagana."
"Most of these solutions are limited in scale, likely to be proprietary and operate in isolation.","Ebisinga ku bino ebigonjoolwa biba bitono mu bunene, biyinza okuba nga bya bwannannyini era nga bikola mu kweyawula."

"However, all these were not premised on nationally endorsed HIE and Interoperability guidelines.",Wabula bino byonna tebyassibwa ku ndagiriro za HIE ezikakasibwa mu ggwanga n’enkola y’okukolagana.
H as a custodian of the healthcare system in the country has embarked on developing its national HIE and Interoperability guidelines to ensure that health data collected is capable of being shared and facilitate primary and secondary uses of patient health information (i.e.,H Nga omukuumi w’enkola y’ebyobulamu mu ggwanga atandise okukola enkola yaayo ey’eggwanga HIE n’enkola y’okukolagana okukakasa nti ebikwata ku by’obulamu ebikung’aanyizibwa bisobola okugabana n’okuyamba enkozesa y’amawulire g’obulamu bw’abalwadde agasookerwako n’agakubiri (i.e.
"It is also important that for any two or more heterogeneous systems to exchange data meaningfully, there must be a mutual standard for data exchange or communication between those systems.","Era kikulu nti enkola zonna bbiri oba okusingawo ezitali zimu okuwanyisiganya amawulire mu ngeri ey’amakulu, wateekwa okubaawo omutindo ogw’okuwanyisiganya amawulire oba empuliziganya wakati w’enkola ezo."

It was facilitated by the national level Public Relations office of the Mo.,Kyakwasaganyizibwa ofiisi y’enkolagana y’abantu ku mutendera gw’eggwanga eya MO.
Each district conducted orientation meeting with the FBOs and cultural leaders with support of HPE&CACSM sub-committee with guidance from NCC decided to conduct this orientation meeting at district level because the stakeholders would have more impact at community level since they are closer to the communities through places of worship.,Buli disitulikiti yakola olukiiko lw’okulungamya n’aba FBO n’abakulembeze b’ebyobuwangwa nga bawagirwa akakiiko akatono aka HPE&CACSM n’obulagirizi okuva mu NCC baasalawo okukola olukiiko luno olw’okuyigiriza ku mutendera gwa disitulikiti kubanga abakwatibwako bandiba n’akakwate akasingawo ku mutendera gw’ekitundu okuva bwe kiri nti bali kumpi n’ebitundu nga bayita mu bifo eby’okusinzizaamu.
The focus was on major FBOs in each district that extensive networks with various religious institutions at community level which have been supporting the Go.,Essira lyali ku FBO ennene mu buli disitulikiti nti emikutu egy’amaanyi n’ebitongole by’eddiini eby’enjawulo ku mutendera gw’ekitundu ebibadde biwagira okugenda.
The meeting brought together representatives of the health professional councils from the 5 regions and were oriented virtually by HPEC and UNEPI.,Olukiiko luno lwagatta abakiise b’enkiiko z’abakugu mu by’obulamu okuva mu bitundu 5 era nga zitunuulidde kumpi HPEC ne UNEPI.
"The participants were selected from the five regions of Busoga, Bugisu, Bukedi, Teso and Karamoja and were oriented virtually by HPEC and UNEPI staff.","Abeetabye mu kugezesebwa kuno basunsuddwa okuva mu bitundu ebitaano ebya Busoga, Bugisu, Bukedi, Teso ne Karamoja era nga batunuulidde kumpi abakozi ba HPEC ne UNEPI."
"As per the data available from 49 districts in the implementing districts of the country, a total of 1712 religious leaders were engaged in 49 districts through advocacy meetings before the implementation of the campaign.","Nga bwe kiri mu biwandiiko ebiriwo okuva mu disitulikiti 49 mu disitulikiti z’eggwanga ezissa mu nkola, omugatte gw’abakulembeze b’eddiini 1712 be baali mu disitulikiti 49 nga bayita mu nkiiko z’okubunyisa amawulire nga kampeyini tennateekebwa mu nkola."
The House-to-House Sensitization through the trained VHTs/LC1s was another key activity under community engagement.,Okumanyisa abantu ku nnyumba okutuuka ku nnyumba nga bayita mu VHTS/LC1s abatendeke gwali mulimu omulala omukulu wansi w’okukwatagana n’abantu b’omukitundu.
"To sensitize communities for the first round of the Polio campaign,  mobilisers (village health teams and LCs) were mobilized and deployed to educate the community on polio campaign.","Okumanyisa abantu ebitundu ku luzannya olusooka olwa kampeyini ya poliyo, abakunga abantu (Village Health Teams and LCs) baakubirizibwa ne basindikibwa okusomesa abantu ku kampeyini ya poliyo."
VHTs were a key channel for message dissemination and raising awareness about the campaign to the community and households using the IPC method.,VHTS yali mukutu mukulu ogw’okubunyisa obubaka n’okumanyisa abantu ku kampeyini eri abantu b’omukitundu n’amaka nga bakozesa enkola ya IPC.
"In most districts, they also registered all eligible children up to the age of 5 years for easy tracking during implementation and followup in case the children were missed.","Mu disitulikiti ezisinga obungi, era baawandiisa abaana bonna abalina ebisaanyizo okutuuka ku myaka 5 olw’okulondoola okwangu mu kiseera ky’okussa mu nkola n’okugoberera singa abaana basubwa."
"These meetings facilitated dialogues on key immunization topics, including the Polio house-to-house campaign, between community leaders/members and the service providers to improve knowledge and awareness levels on Polio and the campaign in the community.","Enkiiko zino zaakwasaganya enteeseganya ku nsonga enkulu ez’okugema, omuli kampeyini ya poliyo ey’awaka n’ennyumba, wakati w’abakulembeze/abakiise b’omu kitundu n’abagaba empeereza okutumbula okumanya n’okumanyisa abantu ku poliyo ne kampeyini mu bantu."
"In total, four preparatory meetings were organized, three of them were at the CHOs Office at Mbale city and one of them was held at the venue of the launch (Busamaga playground) in Mbale City.","Okutwalira awamu, enkiiko nnya ez’okuteekateeka zaategekeddwa, ssatu ku zo zaali ku ofiisi ya CHOS ku Mbale City era emu ku zo yategekebwa mu kifo we banaatunuza (Busamaga Playground) mu kibuga Mbale."
Polio Immunization Launch was successfully held at Busamaga playground in Mbale City and the Director of Public Health-Mo.,Okutongoza okugema poliyo kwabadde bulungi mu Busamaga Playground mu kibuga Mbale ne Dayirekita wa Public Health-Mo.
"In attendance were Development Partners such as WHO Representative, UNICEF Representative, CDC Representative, CAO and RDCs from Mbale region districts.","Mu kubeerawo mwalimu abakolagana n’enkulaakulana nga omubaka wa WHO, omukiise wa UNICEF, omukiise wa CDC, CAO ne RDCs okuva mu disitulikiti z’omu kitundu kya MBALE."
The launch was also attended by the Kenya delegation from Mo.,Okutongoza kuno era kwetabiddwaako ekibinja kya Kenya okuva mu MO.
"Furthermore, they were instrumental Launch of polio campaign-Bungoma-Kenya","Ekirala, baali batongoza ekintu ekiyamba poliyo campaign-bungoma-kenya ."
"ACSM activities at the district and sub-county levels were found to be satisfactory, with IEC distribution completed in all the districts.","Emirimu gya ACSM ku mutendera gwa disitulikiti ne sub-county gyasangibwa nga gimatiza, nga IEC egaba okumalirizibwa mu disitulikiti zonna."
"Social Media Monitoring/social listening UNICEF engaged IPSOS to provide social media monitoring/listening services to track trending public views on Polio and routine immunization in general on the internet and social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and news sites.","Social Media Monitoring/Social Listening UNICEF engaged ipsos okuwa social media okulondoola/okuwuliriza okulondoola trending public views on polio ne bulijjo okugema okutwaliza awamu ku internet ne social media platforms, omuli Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, ne news sites."
"By the end of , IPSOS had analyzed  posts and over 198 million audiences reached by potential impressions (number of times the content was viewed/ seen), with 82% positive conversations,18% Neutral and 2% negative sentiments around immunization, and Polio inclusive .","Ku nkomerero ya , Ipsos yali yeekenneenyezza ebiwandiiko n’abawuliriza abasukka mu bukadde 198 abaatuukibwako ebifaananyi ebiyinza okubaawo (omuwendo gw’emirundi ebirimu byalabibwa/ ebirabibwa), nga waliwo emboozi ennungi 82%,18% neutral ne 2% negative sentiments okwetoloola okugema, ne poliyo inclusive ."
"Positive engagements were mostly around the launch of The Big Catch Up campaign, polio immunization, and focusing on vaccine safety, effectiveness, and public health messaging related to various immunization programs.","Enkolagana ennungi zaali zisinga kwetoloola kutongoza kampeyini ya Big Catch Up, okugema poliyo, n’okussa essira ku bukuumi bw’okugema, okukola obulungi, n’obubaka bw’obulamu bw’abantu obukwata ku nteekateeka ez’enjawulo ez’okugema."
Negative conversations were mostly noticed around vaccine-related content .,Emboozi embi zasinga kwetegereza okwetoloola ebirimu ebikwata ku ddagala erigema .
"In the week of 25th  preceding the campaign, the overall sentiments were positive at 56% compared to the previous week, with Negative sentiments remaining at 38%.","Mu wiiki ya 25 nga kampeyini tennatandika, okutwalira awamu endowooza zaali nnungi ku bitundu 56% bw’ogeraageranya ne wiiki ewedde, ng’endowooza embi zisigadde ku bitundu 38%."
"It had two main objectives of mobilization which include: Boosting High-Performing Areas: In districts like Busia, Jinja, Kamuli, and Tororo, where coverage is already high, community mobilization was aimed at pushing towards near-universal coverage through polio campaign.","Yalina ebigendererwa bibiri ebikulu eby’okukunga abantu omuli: okutumbula ebitundu ebikola obulungi: mu disitulikiti nga Busia, Jinja, Kamuli, ne Tororo, ng’okubikka kwali kwa waggulu dda, okukunga abantu mu kitundu kwali kugendereddwamu okunyigiriza okutuuka kumpi mu buli bantu bonna okuyita mu kampeyini ya poliyo."
"The U-Reporters in the 10 districts were able to mobilize over  people for polio campaign and routine immunization in a ACSM activities at the District level included but were not limited to the following; Engagement with political and civic leaders on routine immunization and supplementary immunization campaigns Participation in media activities through radio talk shows Participation in mobilization of communities through announcements in churches Orientation of religious and cultural leaders, House hold registration and mobilization Conducting community dialogue sessions at sub-county and community level Special populations, Nomads, Islands, fishing communities , insecurity LCVs supervised LC3 chairpersons to hold sensitization meetings for the lower The RDCs conducted sensitization meetings in the district and the same time monitored implementation of polio campaign.","Aba U-Reporters mu disitulikiti 10 basobodde okukunga abantu ku kampeyini za poliyo n’okugema okwa bulijjo mu mirimu gya ACSM ku mutendera gwa disitulikiti nga mwalimu naye nga tebakoma ku bino wammanga; Engagement with political and civic leaders on routine immunization and supplementary immunization campaigns Participation in media activities through radio talk shows Participation in mobilization of communities through announcements in churches Orientation of religious and cultural leaders, House hold registration and mobilization Conducting community dialogue sessions at sub-county and community level Special populations, Nomads, Islands, fishing communities , insecurity LCVs supervised LC3 chairpersons to hold sensitization meetings for the lower The RDCS yakola enkiiko z’okumanyisa abantu mu disitulikiti ate mu kiseera kye kimu ne balondoola okussa mu nkola kampeyini ya poliyo."
DHEs used mobile sound systems on pick-ups to disseminate messages on polio DHEs held sensitization meetings with LCs & VHTs in hard to reach/ serve areas and resistant communities  Islands DHEs conducted sensitization meetings with LCs & VHTs in hard to reach/ serve areas and resistant communities - other hard to reach areas The DHEs conduct 1 day orientation of VHTs and LCs and engaged them in 3 mobilization and registration of children under 5 years DEOs were oriented on polio campaign and given airtime to contact school authorities to mobilize school children for vaccination and preach out to parents to allow their children for vaccination.,DHEs used mobile sound systems on pick-ups to disseminate messages on polio DHEs held sensitization meetings with LCs & VHTs in hard to reach/ serve areas and resistant communities  Islands DHEs conducted sensitization meetings with LCs & VHTs in hard to reach/ serve areas and resistant communities - other hard to reach areas The DHEs conduct 1 day orientation of VHTs and LCs and engaged them in 3 mobilization Era okuwandiisa abaana abali wansi w’emyaka 5 Deos baali batunuulidde kampeyini ya poliyo ne baweebwa airtime okutuukirira abakulira amasomero okukunga abaana b’amasomero okugema n’okubuulira abazadde okukkiriza abaana baabwe okugema.
This was made possible by early involvement of city stakeholders in the planning and coordination.,Kino kyasoboka olw’okwenyigira amangu kw’abakwatibwako mu kibuga mu nteekateeka n’okukwasaganya.
All national level activities were implemented with orientation of 34 DHEs out of 49 DHEs in the target districts.,Emirimu gyonna egy’omutendera gw’eggwanga gyateekebwa mu nkola n’okulungamya DHE 34 ku DHE 49 mu disitulikiti ezigendererwa.
Radio talk shows were successfully conducted on 8 radio stations selected from each of the 5 regions and messages were aired on 8 radio stations and 1 TV station.,Ebivvulu bya leediyo byakolebwa bulungi ku mikutu gya leediyo 8 egyalondeddwa okuva mu buli kimu ku bitundu 5 n’obubaka byalagibwanga ku leediyo 8 ne ttivvi 1.
Polio campaign IEC materials for round one were delivered in time to all the 49 districts by UNICEF and were timely distributed to the community.,Poliyo Campaign IEC Materials for Round One yatuusibwa mu budde mu disitulikiti zonna 49 nga UNICEF era nga zigabibwa mu budde eri abantu.
"Overall, there was high level of awareness which was a collective effort of different sources of information as indicated in the graph below:","Okutwaliza awamu, waaliwo okumanyisa okw’amaanyi okwali kaweefube ow’omuggundu ow’ensibuko z’amawulire ez’enjawulo nga bwe kiragibwa mu kifaananyi wansi:"
"The District Health Educators, District Health Officers and the district leadership were all availed with updated information which they disseminated to the public School based initiatives were increased through engaging the District Education Officers who wrote letters to head teachers and school inspectors to mobilize schools and support the program.","Abasomesa b’ebyobulamu mu disitulikiti, abaserikale b’ebyobulamu mu disitulikiti n’obukulembeze bwa disitulikiti bonna baafunye amawulire agapya ge basaasaanyizza mu nteekateeka z’amasomero ga gavumenti zongerwako nga bayita mu kugatta abaserikale b’ebyenjigiriza mu disitulikiti abawandiikira abasomesa abakulu n’abakebera amasomero okukungaanya amasomero n’okuwagira enteekateeka eno."
"Key bottlenecks/challenges experienced during planning, preparation and The budget for film vans in each region was inadequate.","Ebikulu ebizibu/okusomooza ebibaddewo nga bategeka, okuteekateeka n’embalirira ya kabangali za firimu mu buli kitundu tezaali zimala."
Each region was allocated a film van but was only able to cover a maximum of 4 districts in 5 days allocated for Inadequate funds to implement some activities like the orientation of Members of Parliament on polio campaign,Buli kitundu kyaweebwa kabangali ya firimu naye nga kisobola okubikka ku disitulikiti ezitasukka 4 zokka mu nnaku 5 ezaaweebwa ensimbi ezitamala kuteeka mu nkola emirimu egimu ng’okulungamya abakiise ba Palamenti ku kampeyini za poliyo .
The batteries supplied were not enough and could not last for more than a day of Pockets of religious sects and resistant communities were registered in all the districts and these affected demand for immunization services.,Battery ezaali ziweereddwa tezaali zimala era nga teziyinza kumala lunaku olusukka mu nsawo z’ebibiina by’eddiini n’ebitundu ebiziyiza byawandiisibwa mu disitulikiti zonna era bino byakosa obwetaavu bw’okugema.
The period for campaign planning and implementation was short given the compacted number of activities that were to be implemented in a short time ACSM preparedness data was not visible on the national dashboard because DHEs did not work with the Biostatisticians to populate the dashboard.,Ekiseera ky’okuteekateeka kampeyini n’okussa mu nkola kyali kimpi okusinziira ku muwendo omuzito ogw’emirimu egyali gigenda okuteekebwa mu nkola mu bbanga ttono ebikwata ku kwetegeka kwa ACSM tebyalabika ku dashiboodi y’eggwanga kubanga DHEs tezaakolanga na ba biostatisticians okujjuza dashiboodi.
RDCs and other district leaders are engaged during campaigns and no plans for engaging them during routine immunization.,RDCs n’abakulembeze ba disitulikiti abalala bakwatibwako mu biseera bya kampeyini era tewali nteekateeka ya kuziyingiza mu kugema okwa bulijjo.
"The involvement of RDCs, DISOs, GISOs and PISOs in mobilization for polio campaign, was key in reducing resistance against polio immunization campaign as some reasonable force was applied to get the children of resistant communities Engagement with DHEs in discussions about the ACSM budget during orientation prior to the campaign left no room for some districts to divert ACSM budget Some members of the community who did not see the vaccination teams in their areas after 2 days of the campaign, started making calls to DHOs and DHEs demanding for their children to be vaccinated.","The involvement of RDCs, DISOs, GISOs and PISOs in mobilization for polio campaign, was key in reducing resistance against polio immunization campaign as some reasonable force was applied to get the children of resistant communities Engagement with DHEs in discussions about the ACSM budget during orientation prior to the campaign left no room for some districts to divert ACSM budget Some members of the community who did not see the vaccination teams in their areas after 2 days of the campaign, started making Okuyita Dhos ne Dhes nga baagala abaana baabwe bageme."
This is a sign of high level of awareness and appreciation of polio campaign benefits that resulted into demand and acceptance of polio vaccination.,Kano kabonero ka kumanya n’okusiima emigaso gya kampeyini ya poliyo egy’amaanyi ekyavaamu obwetaavu n’okukkiriza okugema poliyo.
The engagement of influential and supportive religious and community leaders was commended as a good practice since during mobilization they helped to reach the resistant religious sects and communities and preached using the Bible.,Okwenyigira kw’abakulembeze b’eddiini n’ebitundu abaali bawagira n’okuwagira kwasiimibwa ng’enkola ennungi okuva mu kiseera ky’okukunga abantu baayamba okutuuka ku bibiina by’eddiini n’ebitundu ebigumira embeera ne bibuulirwa nga bakozesa Baibuli.
Community engagement and trust building are essential for increased acceptance Mapping the locations of resistant communities/religious sects and following up on whether they take their children for routine immunization and complete the schedule is a sure way of ensuring that resistant communities do not only immunize their children under duress during campaigns but also during routine immunization.,Okukwatagana n‟okukwatagana kw‟ekitundu n‟okuzimba obwesige kyetaagisa nnyo okusobola okwongera okukkiriza okukola maapu y‟ebifo by‟ebitundu ebiziyiza/ebibiina by‟eddiini n‟okugoberera oba batwala abaana baabwe okugema okwa bulijjo n‟okumaliriza enteekateeka y‟engeri enkakafu ey‟okulaba ng‟ebitundu ebiziyiza tebakoma ku kugema baana baabwe mu kiseera kya kampeyini naye era n‟okugema okwa bulijjo.
This is one of the ways to reduce the burden of zero dose and underimmunized children in these communities.,Eno y’emu ku ngeri y’okukendeeza ku buzito bwa zero dose n’abaana abagema mu bitundu bino.
"To mitigate this risk, strict vaccine management protocols need to be enforced, and the absence of n. OPV2 after the vaccination campaign must be validated, confirming that n. OPV2 is not left in the cold chain system.","Okukendeeza ku bulabe buno, enkola enkakali ez’okuddukanya eddagala ly’okugema zeetaaga okuteekebwa mu nkola, n’obutabaawo n. OPV2 oluvannyuma lwa kampeyini y’okugema erina okukakasibwa, okukakasa nti n. OPV2 tesigadde mu nkola ya cold chain."
"Notably, this process is informed by GPEI and the WHO guidance which stipulates that national public health officials and country response teams undertake the necessary steps required to validate n. OPV2 removal.","Ekikulu, enkola eno etegeezebwa GPEI n’obulagirizi bwa WHO obulaga nti abakungu b’ebyobulamu mu ggwanga ne ttiimu z’eggwanga eziddamu okukola emitendera egyetaagisa egyetaagisa okukakasa n. Okuggyawo OPV2."
"Guided by the polio NTF the management, monitoring, removal, and disposal of n. OPV2 at all vaccine storage and use levels are critical and must be confirmed and validated by external monitors who check the documentation and processes of n. OPV2 strict As per GPEI protocols that calls for efficient and effective containment and safe disposal of n. OPV2 vials at the end of the OBR, it was recommended that countries engage vaccine accountability monitors to support the logistics management and ensure that all vials are accounted for at all levels.","Elungamizibwa poliyo NTF Enzirukanya, okulondoola, okuggyawo, n’okusuula n. OPV2 Ku mitendera gyonna egy’okutereka n’okukozesa eddagala erigema nkulu nnyo era girina okukakasibwa n’okukakasibwa abalondoola ab’ebweru abakebera ebiwandiiko n’enkola za n.

The logistics pillar has a core mandate to ensure effective and efficient supply chain for vaccines and related supplies that deliver quality immunization supplies to the right places in the right quantities at the right time in line with effective vaccine management standards.,Empagi y’okutambuza ebintu erina ekiragiro ekikulu eky’okukakasa nti eddagala erigema n’ebikozesebwa ebikwatagana nabyo biweereza ebikozesebwa mu kugema eby’omutindo mu bifo ebituufu mu bungi obutuufu mu kiseera ekituufu nga bikwatagana n’omutindo omulungi ogw’okuddukanya eddagala erigema.
The pillar is responsible for planning and coordination on procurement and delivery of vaccines and logistics to affected areas including inventory and logistics management and support.,Empagi eno evunaanyizibwa ku kutegeka n’okukwasaganya ku kugula n’okutuusa eddagala erigema n’okutambuza ebintu mu bitundu ebikoseddwa omuli eby’obugagga n’okuddukanya okutambuza ebintu n’okuwagira.
"With focus on polio type 2 containment/ safe disposal, the pillar is also responsible for retrieval, inactivation and proper disposal of all the vials at The group comprises a core committee of key immunization stakeholders, and other members that may not be permanent on the group.","Nga essira liteekeddwa ku poliyo ekika kya 2 containment/ safe disposal, empagi era evunaanyizibwa ku kuggya, okutakola n’okusuula obulungi ebidomola byonna mu kibiina kino kirimu akakiiko akakulu ak’abakwatibwako abakulu mu kugema, n’abakiise abalala abayinza obutaba ba lubeerera ku kibiina."
"Included also was assessment of cold chain capacity, recruitment and training of vaccine accountability monitoring team, procurement and distribution of VAM tools, Zip lock bags where unusable vials would be placed, support districts for procurement of fuel for freezing of icepacks in district vaccine stores, cold chain equipment maintenance, transport facilitation for supervision and monitoring by the vaccine accountability monitors VAMs.","Mulimu n’okukebera obusobozi bw’olujegere lw’ennyogovu, okuwandiika n’okutendeka ttiimu erondoola obuvunaanyizibwa bw’okugema, okugula n’okugaba ebikozesebwa bya VAM, ensawo z’okusiba zipu nga ebibya ebitasobola kukozesebwa byanditeekeddwa, okuwagira disitulikiti z’okugula amafuta okusobola okufukirira icepacks mu maduuka g’eddagala erigema disitulikiti, okuddaabiriza ebyuma ebikozesebwa mu kuziyiza eddagala eriziyiza eddagala eriziyiza endwadde."
Pre and intra campaign coordination meetings were held both physical and online and provided updates to stakeholders.,Enkiiko z’okukwasaganya kampeyini nga tezinnabaawo n’ez’omunda zaatuula mu mubiri ne ku yintaneeti era nga ziwa ebipya eri abakwatibwako.
"During implementation, the coordination meetings would receive reports and where gaps were identified such as; Districts that experienced vaccine shortages, mitigation measure to borrow from neighboring districts would be communication and acted on timely.","Mu kiseera ky’okussa mu nkola, enkiiko z’okukwasaganya zandifunye lipoota era nga waliwo ebituli nga; Disitulikiti ezaafuna ebbula ly’eddagala erigema, okukendeeza ku buzibu okwewola okuva mu disitulikiti eziriraanyewo zandibadde mpuliziganya era nga zikolebwa mu budde."

"The primary objective was to achieve 95% immunization coverage for children aged 059 months, using a single dose of the Novel Oral Polio Vaccine (n. OPV) to enhance population immunity.","Ekigendererwa ekikulu kyali kya kutuuka ku bitundu 95% eby’okugema abaana ab’emyaka 059, nga bakozesa ddoozi emu ey’eddagala eriweweeza ku bulwadde bwa poliyo eriyitibwa novel oral polio vaccine (N. OPV) okutumbula obutafaali obuziyiza endwadde."
"The survey findings indicate that vaccination coverage was generally high, with 90.1% of children showing a visible vaccination mark, thereby demonstrating adherence to campaign protocol.","Ebizuuliddwa mu kunoonyereza biraga nti okutwalira awamu okugema kwali kungi, nga 90.1% ku baana balaga akabonero k’okugema akalabika, bwe batyo ne balaga okunywerera ku nkola ya kampeyini."
"Further analysis of OPV dose administration reveals that while the median dose count was five doses per child, 10.7% of children received fewer than three doses.","Okwongera okwekenneenya okuweebwa ddoozi ya OPV kiraga nti wadde omuwendo gwa ddoozi wakati gwali gwa ddoozi ttaano buli mwana, abaana 10.7% baafunanga ddoozi ezitawera ssatu."
"Additionally, although awareness of the SIA was high overalldriven largely by effective communication through community volunteers and radio (reaching 46.5% and 35.3% of the population, respectively)districts such as Amudat and Namayingo recorded lower caregiver awareness, pointing to the need for localized outreach strategies to improve campaign reception.","Okugatta ku ekyo, wadde ng’okumanyisa abantu ku SIA kwali kwa waggulu okutwalira awamu okusinga empuliziganya ennungi nga bayita mu bannakyewa b’omukitundu ne leediyo (okutuuka ku 46.5% ne 35.3% ku bantu, mu kulondako)obugombolola nga Amudat ne Namayingo baawandiika okumanyisa abalabirira abatono, nga balaga obwetaavu bw’enkola z’okutwala abantu mu kitundu okulongoosa mu kampeyini z’okusembeza kampeyini."
"First, it is important to ensure timely provision of essential resources, including transportation and allowances, particularly for teams working in remote regions.","Ekisooka, kikulu okulaba ng’ebintu ebikulu biweebwa mu budde, omuli entambula n’ensako naddala eri ttiimu ezikola mu bitundu ebyesudde."
"Second, expanding mobilization efforts through trusted local leaders and community-specific campaigns is recommended to increase awareness and reduce caregiver hesitancy in lower-coverage districts.","Ekyokubiri, okugaziya kaweefube w’okukunga abantu nga bayita mu bakulembeze b’ebitundu abeesigika ne kampeyini ezikwata ku bantu b’omukitundu kirungi okwongera okumanyisa abantu n’okukendeeza ku kulonzalonza omulabirira mu disitulikiti ezibikka wansi."
"Finally, using higher-quality markers can help maintain visible and reliable vaccination marks, thereby facilitating accurate post-campaign verification.","N’ekisembayo, okukozesa obubonero obw’omutindo ogwa waggulu kiyinza okuyamba okukuuma obubonero bw’okugema obulabika era obwesigika, bwe kityo ne kyanguyiza okukakasa okutuufu oluvannyuma lw’okubuuza."
"In , circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (c.

These campaigns are conducted nationwide as National Immunization Days (NIDs) or in specific high-risk areas as Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs).,Kampeyini zino zikolebwa mu ggwanga lyonna ng’ennaku z’okugema mu ggwanga (NIDs) oba mu bitundu ebitongole eby’omutawaana ennyo ng’ennaku z’okugema abantu mu bitundu by’ensi yonna (SNIDs).
The primary objectives were to increase and sustain high population immunity against polio and to enhance the sensitivity of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance.,Ebigendererwa ebikulu byali byeyongera n’okuyimirizaawo obusimu obuziyiza endwadde obw’amaanyi ku poliyo n’okutumbula obuwulize bw’okulondoola okusannyalala okw’amaanyi okw’amaanyi (AFP).
The specific objective of the LQAS survey were.,Ekigendererwa ekigere eky’okunoonyereza kwa LQAS kyali.
A cluster was defined as a Parish with clear administrative boundaries.,Ekibinja kyannyonnyolwa ng’ekigo ekirina ensalo z’obufuzi ezitegeerekeka obulungi.
All the districts that conducted the house-to-house SIA campaign were assessed.,Disitulikiti zonna ezaakola kampeyini ya SIA ey’awaka n’ennyumba zaali zeekenneenyezebwa.
"In each lot, six clusters were randomly selected by the national LQAS SIAs coordinator using probability proportional to size methods.","Mu buli looti, ebibinja mukaaga byalondebwa mu ngeri ey’ekifuulannenge omukwanaganya wa LQAS SIAS mu ggwanga nga bakozesa enkola z’obusobozi ezigeraageranye n’enkola za sayizi."
Any discrepancies found were updated before sampling the six clusters randomly.,Enjawukana yonna eyazuulibwa yalongoosebwa nga tebannaba kutwala sampuli mu bibinja omukaaga mu ngeri ey’ekifuulannenge.
"The target population was children aged 0-59 months living in the area defined as the lot during the campaign, which was the same target population for the SIAs.","Omuwendo gw’abantu abaali bagendererwamu gwali baana ba myezi 0-59 abaali babeera mu kitundu ekyannyonnyolwa ng’ekibanja mu kiseera kya kampeyini, nga kino kyali kigendererwa kye kimu eri SIAS."
"Selection of Households in a Cluster In each cluster, 10 households with eligible children were randomly selected for the survey.","Okulonda amaka mu kibinja mu buli kibinja, amaka 10 agalina abaana abalina ebisaanyizo gaalondebwa mu ngeri ey’ekifuulannenge okunoonyereza."
"A household was defined as a group of people who share the same kitchen, or a group of people whose sustainment is provided by the same person(s).","Ennyumba yannyonnyolwa ng’ekibinja ky’abantu abagabana effumba lye limu, oba ekibinja ky’abantu nga okuyimirizaawo kwabwe kuweebwa omuntu (abantu) y’omu)."
Selection of the first household in the cluster Surveyors were provided with list of staring villages in each cluster.,Okulonda amaka agasooka mu bapunta b’ekibinja kwaweebwa olukalala lw’ebyalo ebitunudde mu buli kibinja.
The villages were,Ebyalo byali .
"The surveyor asked the head of household, parent/caregiver the number of eligible children who belong to the household and were present at the time of the survey, and then asked him/ her to bring all the eligible children out of the house.","Omupunta yabuuza akulira amaka, omuzadde/omulabirira omuwendo gw’abaana abalina ebisaanyizo abali mu maka era nga baliwo mu kiseera ky’okunoonyereza, oluvannyuma n’amusaba okuggya abaana bonna abalina ebisaanyizo mu nnyumba."
"Where an eligible child was found, a questionnaire was administered.","Omwana eyali alina ebisaanyizo we yasangibwa, waaliwo ekibuuzo."
"Where no eligible child was found in the household, the surveyor did not skip the next household.","Awali omwana atali musajja alina ebisaanyizo mu maka, omupunta teyabuuka maka agaddako."
"When the edge of the village was reached before 10 eligible children in the cluster were surveyed, the surveyor moved to the nearest village in the same Cluster to complete the survey in the cluster.","Empenda y’ekyalo bwe yatuusibwako ng’abaana 10 abaali n’ebisaanyizo mu kibinja tebannaba kupunta, omupunta yagenda ku kyalo ekyali okumpi mu kibinja kye kimu okumaliriza okunoonyereza mu kibinja."
Ascertaining Vaccination Status Vaccination status of an eligible child was ascertained using a fingermark on the left small finger.,Okuzuula embeera y’okugema embeera y’okugema omwana alina ebisaanyizo kyazuulibwa nga bakozesa akabonero k’engalo ku mukono omutono ogwa kkono.
Any child who did not have the fingermark on the left small finger was considered as not vaccinated.,Omwana yenna eyali talina kabonero ka ngalo ku lunwe olutono olwa kkono yatwalibwanga ng’atagemeddwa.
Verbal history was NOT considered.,Ebyafaayo by’ebigambo tebyalowoozebwako.
"During training of the district teams to implement the house to house Polio SIAs, they were guided to apply two drops of OPV to each child aged 0-59 months and mark the left small finger with an indelible ink immediately as evidence of immunization.","Mu kutendekebwa kwa ttiimu za disitulikiti okussa mu nkola ennyumba ennyumba ya poliyo SIAS, baalung’amibwa okusiiga amatondo ga OPV abiri ku buli mwana ow’emyezi 0-59 n’okussaako akabonero ku lunwe olutono olwa kkono nga lulina yinki etazikirizibwa amangu ddala ng’obujulizi bw’okugema."
"The form contained questions on household location (Lot, Sub County, parish and village); GPS coordinates of the starting village in the lot; date of the survey; number of eligible children (aged months) in the household and those available/seen at the time of the survey; OPV LQAS surveyors and supervisors were trained for 3 days including one day for field practice on the key concepts of LQAS methodology, sampling strategy, data collection, data analysis and interpretation, and the survey instruments (both paper and in ODK software).","Ffoomu yalimu ebibuuzo ku kifo w’obeera (Lot, sub county, parish ne village); GPS coordinates of the starting village mu kalulu; Olunaku lw’okunoonyereza; omuwendo gw’abaana abalina ebisaanyizo (emyezi egy’emyaka egy’emyaka) mu maka n’abo abaliwo/abalabibwa mu kiseera ky’okunoonyereza; OPV LQAS Surveyors and Supervisors baatendekebwa okumala ennaku 3 omuli olunaku lumu olw’okwegezangamu mu nnimiro ku ndowooza enkulu ez’enkola ya LQAS, enkola y’okutwala sampuli, okukung’aanya amawulire, okwekenneenya amawulire n’okutaputa, n’ebikozesebwa mu kupunta (empapula zombi ne mu pulogulaamu ya ODK)."
The surveyors were also advised to complete the cluster data collection form in paper as backup.,Abapunta era baweereddwa amagezi okumaliriza foomu y’okukung’aanya ebikwata ku kibinja mu lupapula nga backup.
"Each surveyor was assigned to collect data for a lot, with support of the supervisor where necessary.","Buli mupunta yaweebwa okukung’aanya ebikwata ku bintu bingi, ng’awagira omulabirira we kyetaagisa."
Ensuring high coverage across all areas was emphasized as crucial to maintaining community-wide immunity against polio.,Okukakasa nti okubikka kungi mu bitundu byonna kyassibwako essira nga kikulu nnyo mu kukuuma obutafaali obuziyiza obulwadde bwa poliyo mu kitundu kyonna.
"This analysis helped pinpoint districts that may need additional support to ensure consistent dosing, with the goal of optimizing immunity levels in every community.","Okwekenenya kuno kwayamba okulaga disitulikiti eziyinza okwetaaga obuyambi obw’enjawulo okulaba nga ziweebwa eddagala erikwatagana, n’ekigendererwa eky’okulongoosa emitendera gy’obutafaali obuziyiza endwadde mu buli kitundu."
"The LQAS team also assessed community awareness about polio vaccination, which is essential for encouraging participation and understanding the importance of immunization.","Ttiimu ya LQAS era yeetegereza okumanyisa abantu ku kugema poliyo, nga kino kyetaagisa nnyo okukubiriza okwetaba n’okutegeera obukulu bw’okugema."
"They discussed districts with high awareness levels and successful outreach efforts, as well as areas where awareness was comparatively low.","Bateesa ku disitulikiti ezirina emitendera egy’okumanyisa abantu egy’amaanyi n’okufuba okutuuka ku buwanguzi, wamu n’ebitundu awaali okumanyisa abantu ku wansi."
"Recommendations focused on strengthening information dissemination and community engagement in regions where awareness about polio prevention and the vaccination campaign was less robust, helping to enhance future participation and support for immunization initiatives.","Ebiteeso byassa essira ku kunyweza okubunyisa amawulire n’okukwatagana n’abantu mu bitundu ng’okumanyisa abantu ku kuziyiza poliyo n’okugema kampeyini tekwali kwa maanyi nnyo, okuyamba okutumbula okwetaba mu biseera eby’omu maaso n’okuwagira enteekateeka z’okugema."
"The mean age was 26.3 months (SD = 16.6 months), aligning with the primary target for polio vaccination.","Emyaka gyali gya myezi 26.3 (SD = 16.6 months), nga gikwatagana n’ekigendererwa ekikulu eky’okugema poliyo."
"Notably, 22.8% of the children were under 12 months, underscoring the importance of early vaccination for this higher-risk age group.","Ekikulu, abaana 22.8% baali wansi w’emyezi 12, nga baggumiza obukulu bw’okugema nga bukyali eri ekibinja kino eky’emyaka egy’akabi ennyo."
"Additionally, 16.8% were over 48 months, indicating the need to maintain vaccine outreach for older children within the 059-month target range.","Okugatta ku ekyo, 16.8% baali basukka mu myezi 48, ekiraga obwetaavu bw’okukuuma okutuuka ku kugema abaana abakulu mu myezi 059 egy’ekigendererwa."
"A total of  children aged 0-59 months from districts, including 4 cities, were evaluated for the presence of a visible finger mark on the little finger of the left hand as evidence of vaccination during the Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA).","Abaana bonna awamu ab’emyaka 0-59 okuva mu disitulikiti, nga kuliko n’ebibuga 4, baali beekenneenyezebwa okulaba oba waliwo akabonero k’engalo akalabika ku kanfa akatono ak’omukono ogwa kkono ng’obujulizi bw’okugema mu kiseera ky’okugema okw’okugatta (SIA)."
"Addressing these gaps will be essential in bolstering the accuracy of vaccination tracking and ensuring comprehensive Exhibit 3: Reasons contributing to the absence of a finger mark However, 9.9% of children were without a visible finger mark, indicating areas of improvement in marking practices and campaign coverage.","Okukola ku bituli bino kijja kuba kyetaagisa nnyo mu kunyweza obutuufu bw’okulondoola okugema n’okukakasa okwolesebwa okujjuvu 3: Ensonga eziviirako obutabaawo kabonero ka ngalo wabula, 9.9% ku baana baali tebalina kabonero ka ngalo akalabika, nga balaga ebitundu eby’okulongoosa mu nkola y’okussaako obubonero n’okubikka ku kampeyini."
"Notably, certain districts showed higher counts of unmarked children, which may reflect logistical challenges, marking inconsistencies, or other regional factors.","Ekikulu, disitulikiti ezimu zalaga okubala okusingawo okw’abaana abatalina kabonero, ekiyinza okulaga okusoomoozebwa mu nteekateeka, obubonero obutakwatagana, oba ensonga endala ez’ekitundu."
This was greatly improved in Round 2.,Kino kyalongooseddwa nnyo mu round 2.
"These findings indicate that while the OPV campaign was largely successful in some areas, there is a critical need to address specific challenges in lowerperforming districts to ensure full immunization coverage and mitigate polio risks.","Ebizuuliddwa bino biraga nti wadde nga kampeyini ya OPV okusinga yatuuka ku buwanguzi mu bitundu ebimu, waliwo obwetaavu obw’amaanyi obw’okukola ku kusoomoozebwa okwetongodde mu disitulikiti ezikola obulungi okulaba ng’okugema okujjuvu kubikkulirwa n’okukendeeza ku bulabe bwa poliyo."
"The mark was applied to the wrong finger or incorrectly, leading to no visible mark on the left finger The household was not visited by the vaccination team due to scheduling or logistical challenges.","Akabonero kaasiigibwa ku ngalo enkyamu oba mu bukyamu, ekivaako obutalaga kabonero akalabika ku lunwe olwa kkono amaka tegakyalirwa ttiimu y’okugema olw’enteekateeka oba okusoomoozebwa mu nteekateeka."
"The child was away when the vaccination team visited, often due to family obligations or mobility.","Omwana yali taliiwo nga ttiimu y’okugema yakyala, emirundi mingi olw’obuvunaanyizibwa bw’amaka oba okutambula."
"Compliance Some caregivers may have refused the vaccination, though this was Includes issues like administrative errors, unavailability of marking ink,","Okugoberera Abalabirira abamu bayinza okuba nga bagaanyi okugema, wadde nga kino kyali kizingiramu ensonga nga ensobi mu by’okuddukanya, obutafuna kussaako kabonero ku yinki, ."
"Moderate Fail (26.7% of Districts)-12 districts for Round 1 and 10% - 5 Districts for Round 2  were classified as Moderate Fail, with 4-8 unvaccinated children per district.","Okulemererwa okw’ekigero (26.7% ku disitulikiti)-12 Disitulikiti za round 1 ne 10% - 5 Districts for round 2 zateekebwa mu kibinja ky’okulemererwa okw’ekigero, nga 4-8 abaana abatagemesebwa buli disitulikiti."
"Districts such as Amudat, Budaka, Bududa, Bukwo, Busia, Butaleja, Mayuge, Mbale, Napak, and Soroti City are in this category for Round 1 and Amudat for Round 2, highlighting the need for targeted support to improve coverage in future campaigns.","Disitulikiti nga Amudat, Budaka, Budaka, Bukwo, Busia, Butaleja, Mayuge, Mbale, Napak, ne Soroti City ziri mu kiti kino mu lawundi 1 ne Amudat mu lawundi eyookubiri, ekiraga obwetaavu bw’okuwagira okugenderera okulongoosa mu kampeyini ezijja."
"Butebo and Jinja Cityin Round 1 were classified as Very Poor Fail, with more than 19 unvaccinated children.","Butebo ne Jinja Cityin Round 1 baateekebwa mu kibinja ky’ababi ennyo, nga balina abaana abasoba mu 19 abatagemeddwa."
"However, no district was in this category in round 2.",Wabula tewali disitulikiti yali mu kiti kino mu lawundi eyookubiri.
"These districts face higher risks of polio outbreaks, especially due to the presence of mobile populations and foreign communities, which can affect consistent immunization access.","Disitulikiti zino zifuna obulabe obw’amaanyi obw’okubutuka kwa poliyo naddala olw’okubeerawo kw’abantu abatambula n’abantu abagwiira, ekiyinza okukosa okutuuka ku kugema okutali kwa bulijjo."
"On the other hand, caregivers who were aware of AFP had an average of 5.14 OPV doses administered to their children.","Ku luuyi olulala, abalabirira abaali bamanyi AFP baalina ddoozi za OPV 5.14 eziweebwa abaana baabwe ku kigero kya 5.14."
This suggests that caregivers who are knowledgeable about AFP tend to have children who receive more doses of the Oral Polio Vaccine.,Kino kiraga nti abalabirira abamanyi ku AFP batera okuzaala abaana abafuna ddoozi nnyingi ez’eddagala eriweweeza ku bulwadde bwa poliyo ery’omu kamwa.
The goal was to ensure thorough mobilization and implementation of the SIA to reach all children aged 059 months.,Ekigendererwa kyali kya kulaba nga SIA ekunga mu bujjuvu n’okussa mu nkola okutuuka ku baana bonna ab’emyezi 059.
"The lower awareness in these districts highlights challenges that may include limited access to reliable information sources, lower engagement from local leaders, or logistical barriers in reaching more isolated communities.","Okumanya okutono mu disitulikiti zino kulaga okusoomoozebwa okuyinza okubeeramu okufuna okutono ku nsonda z’amawulire ezeesigika, okwenyigira okutono okuva mu bakulembeze b’ebitundu, oba ebiziyiza eby’enteekateeka mu kutuuka mu bitundu ebisinga okubeera ebyesudde."
These areas may require additional targeted communication efforts in future campaigns to ensure full community readiness.,Ebitundu bino biyinza okwetaagisa kaweefube ow’enjawulo ow’empuliziganya agenderere mu kampeyini ezijja okulaba nga weetegese mu bujjuvu abantu b’omu kitundu.
"Overall, while caregiver awareness was high in many districts, certain areas require focused improvements.","Okutwalira awamu, wadde ng’okumanyisa abantu ku balabirira kwali kungi mu disitulikiti nnyingi, ebitundu ebimu byetaaga okulongoosaamu essira."
"Strategies that proved successful in high-awareness regions, such as Moroto and Bukedea, could be adapted and implemented in districts with lower awareness levels to enhance community engagement and support for upcoming A wide variety of communication methods were utilized to overcome barriers to vaccination, such as low motivation, mistrust, and lack of awareness about routine immunization.","Enkola ezaalaga nti zifunye obuwanguzi mu bitundu ebimanyi ennyo, nga Moroto ne Bukedea, zisobola okukyusibwa ne ziteekebwa mu nkola mu disitulikiti ezirina emitendera egy’okumanya okutono okutumbula enkolagana y’abantu n’okuwagira enkola ez’enjawulo ez’enjawulo ezijja zaakozesebwa okuvvuunuka ebiziyiza okugema, gamba ng’okukubirizibwa okutono, obuteesiga, n’obutamanya ku kugema okwa bulijjo."
"Door-to-door mobilization efforts were particularly emphasized, with Village Health Teams (VHTs) and local leaders visiting households, markets, churches, shops, playgrounds, and schools to ensure that every household was informed and motivated to vaccinate their children.","Kaweefube w’okukungaanya ennyumba ku nnyumba yassibwako essira naddala, nga ttiimu z’ebyobulamu by’ebyalo (VHTs) n’abakulembeze b’ebitundu abakyalira amaka, obutale, amakanisa, amaduuka, ebifo ebisanyukirwamu, n’amasomero okulaba nga buli maka gategeezebwa era nga gakubirizibwa okugema abaana baabwe."
The following channels were identified as the most effective sources of awareness among caregivers and the public:,Emikutu gino wammanga gyazuulibwa ng’ensibuko y’okumanyisa abantu abasinga okukola obulungi mu balabirira n’abantu bonna:
"Given AFPs critical role in polio surveillance and early detection, increasing caregiver knowledge is essential to prompt recognition and reporting of potential cases.","Kubanga AFPS omulimu omukulu mu kulondoola poliyo n’okuzuula amangu, okwongera okumanya ku kulabirira kyetaagisa okusobola okutegeera amangu n’okutegeeza emisango egisobola okubaawo."
"Enhancing awareness can improve early identification of AFP symptoms, supporting better surveillance and response to potential polio cases.","Okwongera okumanyisa abantu kiyinza okulongoosa okuzuula amangu obubonero bwa AFP, okuwagira okulondoola okulungi n‟okuddamu ku balwadde abayinza okuba poliyo."
"Therefore, future outreach efforts should prioritize raising awareness about AFP, especially in regions with historically low coverage, to strengthen community involvement in polio prevention and overall health vigilance.","N’olwekyo, kaweefube w’okutuuka ku bantu mu biseera eby’omu maaso alina okukulembeza okumanyisa abantu ku AFP naddala mu bitundu ebirina ebyafaayo ebitono, okunyweza okwenyigira kw’abantu mu kuziyiza poliyo n’okutunuulira obulamu okutwalira awamu."
"Vaccination Marking Challenges In many districts such as Bududa and Soroti, the markers used were of low quality, causing the vaccination marks on childrens fingers to fade or wash off.","Okusoomoozebwa kw’okugema obubonero mu disitulikiti nnyingi nga Buda ne Soroti, obubonero obwakozesebwa bwali bwa mutindo gwa wansi, ekyaviirako obubonero bw’okugema ku ngalo z’abaana okuzikira oba okunaaba."
"Some children were marked on the wrong finger or not marked at all, indicating gaps in training and adherence to marking protocols.","Abaana abamu baateekebwako akabonero ku lunwe olukyamu oba nga tebawandiikiddwako n’akatono, ekiraga ebituli mu kutendekebwa n’okunywerera ku nkola z’okussaako obubonero."
"Awareness and Community Engagement Some parents were unaware of the vaccination campaign, especially in areas with limited community mobilization or lower literacy rates.",Okumanyisa abantu n‟okukwatagana n‟abantu b‟omukitundu Abazadde abamu baali tebamanyi ku kampeyini y‟okugema naddala mu bitundu ebirina okukungaanya okutono mu bantu oba emiwendo gy‟okusoma n‟okuwandiika okutono.
"This issue contributed to In certain areas, caregivers were hesitant or outright refused to vaccinate their children, which calls for enhanced persuasion efforts and education on vaccine Households Not Visited: Some vaccination teams did not reach all households in certain clusters, leaving eligible children unvaccinated.","Ensonga eno yayambako mu bitundu ebimu, abalabirira baali balonzalonza oba ddala ne bagaana okugema abaana baabwe, ekisaba okunywezebwa okufuba okusikiriza n’okusomesa amaka agagema agatakyalibwa: ttiimu ezimu ez’okugema tezaatuuka mu maka gonna mu bibinja ebimu, ne zireka abaana abalina ebisaanyizo nga tebagemeddwa."
This was sometimes due to teams camping at trading centers rather than conducting thorough houseto-house visits.,Kino oluusi kyava ku ttiimu okusimba enkambi mu bifo eby’obusuubuzi okusinga okulambula obulungi ennyumba z’awaka.
"Passive resistance observed among village guides in Namisindwa, expecting Bududa community members were reluctant to engage, fearing potential Areas with mobile or nomadic populations posed challenges for consistent outreach and tracking, leading to lower coverage rates.","Obuziyiza obutakola (passive resistance) obwetegerezeddwa mu balagirizi b’ebyalo mu Namisindwa, nga basuubira nti abantu b’omukitundu buda baali tebaagala kwenyigira, nga batya ebitundu ebiyinza okuba nga birimu abantu abatambula oba abatambuze ebireetera abantu okusoomoozebwa okutuuka ku kutuuka n’okulondoola obutakyukakyuka, ekivaako emiwendo gy’okubikka okukka."

"Challenges to campaign implementation Challenges were mainly extracted from the district reports submitted to the National EOC and they include but are not limited to the following; Sub optimal budget fingers; 40 villages were missed in the budget, little fuel for failure of timely last mile delivery of logistics Late supply of fuel to supervisors; Supervisors accessed fuel lately on the implementation day despite the timely arrival of Fuel cards.","Okusoomoozebwa mu kusoomoozebwa kw’okussa mu nkola kampeyini okusinga kwaggibwa mu lipoota za disitulikiti ezaaweebwayo eri EOC y’eggwanga era nga zirimu naye nga tezikoma ku bino wammanga; Sub Engalo z’embalirira ezisinga obulungi; Ebyalo 40 byasubwa mu mbalirira, amafuta matono olw’okulemererwa mu kiseera ekisembayo mu kutuusa eby’okutambuza amafuta mu kiseera ekikeerezi eri abalabirira; Abalabirira baafuna amafuta ennaku zino ku lunaku lw’okussa mu nkola wadde nga kaadi z’amafuta zaatuuse mu budde."
The 2 indelible   ink markers allocated per vaccination team were inadequate since the teams have to vaccinate in more than 3 villages for example Kaliro The teams allocated were very limited and this caused the vaccination teams move to more than three villages in the four   days of implementation.,Obubonero bwa yinki 2 obutazikirizibwa obwaweebwa buli ttiimu y’okugema tebwali bumala okuva ttiimu bwe zirina okugema mu byalo ebisukka mu 3 okugeza Kaliro ttiimu ezaaweebwa zaali ntono nnyo era kino kyaleetera ttiimu z’okugema okugenda ku byalo ebisukka mu bisatu mu nnaku ennya ez’okussa mu nkola.
The Indelible ink markers quality was not good and most fingers marked were observed to be fading away on the next day.,Omutindo gwa ink markers ogutazikirizibwa tegwali mulungi era engalo ezisinga obungi zaalabiddwa nga ziggwaawo enkeera.
This was addressed through engagements.,Kino kyakolebwako nga bayita mu kwanjula.
"House hold registration forms were not delivered among the logistic delivered, necessitating the District to print them out.","Ffoomu z’okwewandiisa mu House Hold tezaatuusibwa mu logistic eyatuusibwa, nga kyetaagisa disitulikiti okuzikuba mu mpapula."
The compressed schedule for key campaign activities was straining for human and logistical resources.,Enteekateeka enyigirizibwa ey’emirimu emikulu egy’okunoonya akalulu yali esika ku by’obugagga by’abantu n’eby’enteekateeka.
"Vaccinators, VHTs and LC1s were dissatisfied with the payment process of the transport allowances that had been provided.","Abagema, VHT ne LC1 tebaali bamativu n’enkola y’okusasula ssente z’entambula ezaali ziweereddwa."
Inadequate funds allocated for example Napak District has 14 sub-counties which are so distant and has no provision for the hard to reach supervisors.,Ensimbi ezitamala nga ziweebwa okugeza Disitulikiti ya Napak erina sub-counties 14 nga zino wala nnyo era nga tezirina nteekateeka ya balabirira abazibu okutuuka ku balabirizi.
"No clear and adequate facilitation for the DHO Inadequate vaccines to complete the campaign ODK app was not functional, supervisors faced challenges using it.","Tewali kwanguyiza era kumala ku ddagala erigema DHO eritamala kumaliriza app ya kampeyini ya ODK teyali nkola, abalabirira baayolekagana n’okusoomoozebwa nga bakozesa."
Vaccination of targeted children in schools on first day of implementation was very helpful and most nursery kids were reached.,Okugema abaana abagendereddwamu mu masomero ku lunaku olusooka nga bateeka mu nkola kyayamba nnyo era abaana abasinga obungi aba nasale baatuukirwako.
"To provide standard Tally sheet well labelled at the back of the sheet Provision of protective gears such as umbrellas, gumboots, raincoats, clear paper Inter country campaigns should start at the same time.","Okuwa tally sheet eya bulijjo ewandiikiddwa obulungi emabega w’olupapula lw’okugaba ebyuma ebikuuma nga umbrellas, gumboots, raincoats, clear paper inter country campaigns zirina okutandika mu kiseera kye kimu."
Schools should be called off during campaigns We need to deploy static teams at the port of entry to avoid leakage The security personnel should be budged and deployed officially next campaigns The 2 round Outbreak Response SIA in the 49 districts and 4 regions was successfully implemented from 3rd  6th October and 7th  10th .,Amasomero galina okuyimirizibwa mu kiseera kya kampeyini ze twetaaga okuteeka ttiimu ezitakyukakyuka ku mwalo gw'okuyingira okwewala okuvuba Abakuumi balina okukazibwako n'okuyiwa kampeyini eziddako mu butongole The 2 round Outbrekis response SIA in the 49 districts and 4 regions was successfuiled imposureted from 3rd 6th October and 7th 10th .
The proportion of lots that passed the survey in R2 was almost double that of the R1 coverage indicating also that the quality of the campaign was much improved.,Ekitundu kya looti ezaayita mu kunoonyereza mu R2 kyali kumpi emirundi ebiri ku R1 coverage eraga era nti omutindo gwa kampeyini gwali gulongooseddwa nnyo.
"In this campaign, great lessons were learnt as well as best practices and challenges documented with a view to improve subsequent rounds.","Mu kampeyini eno, eby’okuyiga ebinene byayigibwa awamu n’enkola ennungi n’okusoomoozebwa okwawandiikibwa n’ekigendererwa eky’okulongoosa lawundi ezaddirira."
"This achievement is mainly attributed to the commitment and remarkable resilience of district and sub county supervisors, DCCT and vigilance of the district bio stat in empowering teams to report promptly and timely data entry.","Obutuukirivu buno businga kuva ku kwewaayo n’okugumira okwewuunyisa kw’abalabirira disitulikiti ne sub County, DCCT n’obwegendereza bwa District Bio Stat mu kuwa ttiimu amaanyi okukola lipoota mu bwangu era mu budde."
"However, inadequate funding due to under budgeting caused failure for timely lastmile vaccine delivery, late distribution of fuel to supervisor, noninvolvement of district drivers  lack of adequate transport for distribution, poor quality of indelible ink, poor vaccine accountability due to suboptimal competencies of recruited VAMS, inadequate IEC materials, delayed report submission, low turn up for day review meetings were the major hindrances that stumbled the campaign.","Naye, ensimbi ezitamala olw’okukola embalirira zaaleetawo okulemererwa mu budde okugema eddagala eriweweeza ku bulwadde bwa lastmile, okulwawo okugaba amafuta eri omulabirira, obutayingizaamu bavuzi ba disitulikiti obutaba na ntambula emala okugabibwa, omutindo omubi ogwa yinki etasaanyizibwawo, obuvunaanyizibwa obubi obw’okugema olw’obusobozi obutono obw’okuddamu okutuukirizibwa kw’abakulu mu kiseera ky’okuddamu okutuukirizibwa kw’abakulu b’okudda enkiiko z’okukka kw’abakulu mu kiseera ky’okukkakkana nga bafunye obuzibu obw’okukka wansi."

The latest edition of the World health statistics provides an essential examination of trends in global health over the past two decades that have shaped the world in which we live.,Ekitabo ekisembyeyo ekya World Health Statistics kiwa okwekenneenya okwetaagisa okw’emitendera mu by’obulamu mu nsi yonna mu myaka amakumi abiri egiyise egyabumba ensi mwe tubeera.
"It highlights the sobering reality that, due largely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have both regressed to the level a decade ago, although the impact was unequal across regions and income groups.","Kiraga ensonga entuufu nti, okusinga ku ngeri ssennyiga omukambwe eya Covid-19, obulamu bw’ensi yonna n’obulamu obulungi byombi bizze emabega okutuuka ku mutendera emyaka kkumi egiyise, wadde ng’enkosa yali tefaanagana mu bitundu byonna n’ebibinja by’enyingiza."
"This holds true for every WHO region except the African Region, where communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions are still responsible for over half of all deaths.","Kino kituufu ku buli kitundu kya WHO okuggyako ekitundu kya Afrika, embeera ezisiigibwa, eza maama, ez’okuzaala n’endya gye zikyavunaanyizibwa ku kufa okusukka mu kitundu ku bonna."
"Globally, the rate of improvement in healthy life expectancy has slowed in recent years, reflecting the increasing burden of NCDs, and the need to strengthen health systems to improve quality of care and meet increasing demands.","Mu nsi yonna, omutindo gw‟okulongoosa mu bulamu obulungi gukendedde mu myaka egiyise, ekiraga omugugu gwa NCDs ogweyongera, n‟obwetaavu bw‟okunyweza enkola z‟ebyobulamu okutumbula omutindo gw‟okulabirira n‟okutuukiriza obwetaavu obweyongera."
"At the heart of this years report is a critical call to action to accelerate progress towards the triple billion targets set out in WHOs 13th General Programme of Work, and the Sustainable Development Goals on which they are based.","Ku lipoota y’emyaka gino kuli ku mulanga omukulu ogw’okukola okwanguya enkulaakulana okutuuka ku biruubirirwa eby’obuwumbi busatu ebiragiddwa mu nteekateeka y’emirimu eya WOS ey’omulundi ogwa 13, n’ebiruubirirwa by’enkulaakulana ey’olubeerera kwe byesigamiziddwa."
"Globally, 585million more people are expected to be covered by essential health services without catastrophic health spending by 2025 than in 2018  just over halfway to the target of 1billion  and 777million more people are expected to be better protected from health emergencies.","Mu nsi yonna, abantu bangi obukadde 585 be basuubirwa okusasulwa empeereza y’ebyobulamu enkulu awatali nsaasaanya ya bulamu mu ngeri ey’akatyabaga omwaka 2025 okusinga mu 2018 ekitundu ekisukka mu kitundu ku kiruubirirwa kya bukadde 1 ate abantu bangi obukadde 777 be basuubirwa okukuumibwa obulungi okuva ku bulamu obw’amangu."
"Healthier populations provide the sole bright spot, where an estimated 1.5billion more people will enjoy healthier lives by 2025.","Abantu abalamu obulungi bawa ekifo kyokka ekitangaavu, nga abantu ababalirirwamu obuwumbi bumu n’ekitundu bajja kunyumirwa obulamu obulungi mu mwaka gwa 2025."
"Overall, however, progress is insufficient to achieve the health-related SDG These gaps reflect huge, missed opportunities in improving global health, and underscore the urgency for the global community to intensify efforts and investments in health.","Okutwaliza awamu, wabula, enkulaakulana temala kutuuka ku SDG eyeekuusa ku by’obulamu bino ebituli bino biraga emikisa eminene, egyasubwa mu kulongoosa ebyobulamu by’ensi yonna, n’okuggumiza obwangu eri abantu b’ensi yonna okwongera amaanyi n’okuteeka ssente mu by’obulamu."
Country-focused stories are presented throughout the report to highlight efforts undertaken to address various health issues.,Emboozi ezitunuulidde eggwanga ziweebwa mu lipoota yonna okulaga kaweefube akoleddwa okukola ku nsonga z’ebyobulamu ez’enjawulo.
The information presented in World health statistics is based on data available from global monitoring as of .,Amawulire agaweereddwa mu bibalo by'ebyobulamu mu nsi yonna geesigamiziddwa ku biwandiiko ebifunibwa okuva mu kulondoola ensi yonna okuva mu .
"The data reference years vary, however, as data series are updated on different timelines and with different lag between the data reference year and the publication year.","Emyaka gya data egy’okujuliza gyawukana, naye, nga data series zitereezebwa ku biseera eby’enjawulo era nga zirina okuddirira okw’enjawulo wakati w’omwaka gw’okujuliza data n’omwaka gw’okufulumya."
Data have been compiled primarily from publications and databases produced and managed by WHO or United Nations partner entities and supplemented with data and analyses from peer-reviewed publications.,Data zibadde zikuŋŋaanyizibwa okusinga okuva mu bitabo n’ebifo ebikuumirwamu amawulire ebifulumizibwa era ne biddukanyizibwa ebitongole by’omukago gwa WHO oba United Nations Partner era nga byongerwako data n’okwekenneenya okuva mu bitabo ebikebereddwa bannaabwe.
"The WHO regions most affected were the Region of the Americas and South-East Asia Region, with declines of about 3 years in life expectancy and 2.5 years in HALE between 2019 and 2021.","Ebitundu bya WHO ebisinga okukosebwa byali kitundu kya Americas ne South-East Asia, nga okukendeera kw’emyaka nga 3 mu bulamu bw’obulamu ate emyaka 2.5 mu Hale wakati wa 2019 ne 2021."
"In the Region of the Americas it was the number one cause of death in both years, and ranked in the top five causes for all regions except for the African and Western At the midway point for the SDGs, progress on health-related Goals has been mixed.","Mu kitundu ky’Amerika kye kyali nnamba emu ekyavaako okufa mu myaka gyombi, era nga kikwata ekifo kya ttaano ezisinga okuviirako ebitundu byonna okuggyako eby’omu Afirika n’eby’amaserengeta mu makkati g’oluguudo lwa SDGS, enkulaakulana ku biruubirirwa ebikwata ku by’obulamu ebadde etabuse."
"None of these have yet been achieved, and none are on track under current trends.","Tewali n’emu ku zino ebadde etuukiddwaako, era tewali kiri ku mulamwa wansi w’emitendera egy’omulembe."
"However, most indicators  are showing movement in the right direction globally.","Naye, ebiraga ebisinga biba biraga entambula mu kkubo ettuufu mu nsi yonna."

It is evident that most indicators suffered from a data shortage at various degrees across countries.,Kya lwatu nti ebipimo ebisinga byabonaabona olw’ebbula ly’amawulire ku diguli ez’enjawulo mu nsi yonna.
"More often than not, the lack of data will not be limited to the data required by the Triple Billion; rather, it is deeply entrenched in poorly performing health information systems.","Emirundi mingi, obutaba na data tekijja kukoma ku data eyeetaagibwa obuwumbi busatu; Wabula, esimbye nnyo amaanyi mu nkola z’amawulire agakwata ku by’obulamu ezikola obubi."

Various tools have been developed by WHO to enhance countries data capacity.,Ebikozesebwa eby’enjawulo bikoleddwa ekitongole kya WHO eky’okutumbula obusobozi bw’ensi data.
"For example, the WHO SCORE for health data technical package was designed to assess the performance of national health information systems, identify the data gaps and provide a toolbox to improve various areas of a functioning health information system .","Okugeza, ekitongole kya WHO eky’obubonero bw’eby’obulamu mu by’obulamu kyakolebwa okwekenneenya enkola y’enkola z’amawulire agakwata ku bulamu bw’eggwanga, okuzuula ebituli mu data n’okuwa ekibokisi ky’ebikozesebwa okulongoosa ebitundu eby’enjawulo eby’enkola y’amawulire g’ebyobulamu agakola ."
The Data management competency framework (DMCF) developed by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific is another example of such a tool; it enables health information managers to identify capacity gaps and drive competency development at various levels (Box 3.1).,Enkola y’okuddukanya amawulire (DMCF) eyakolebwa ofiisi y’ekitundu ky’ensi yonna (WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific) kye kyokulabirako ekirala eky’ekintu ng’ekyo; Kisobozesa abaddukanya amawulire g’ebyobulamu okuzuula ebituli mu busobozi n’okuvuga enkulaakulana y’obusobozi ku mitendera egy’enjawulo (Box 3.1).

Papua New Guinea has set out a clear path as the first country to adopt the framework.,Papua New Guinea etaddewo ekkubo eritegeerekeka obulungi ng’eggwanga erisooka okwettanira enkola eno.
"These competency profiles are invaluable as they provide a clear foundation for developing tools to assess training needs and formulating comprehensive, long-term capacity-building strategies.","Ebifaananyi bino eby’obusobozi bya muwendo nnyo kuba biwa omusingi omutegeerekeka ogw’okukola ebikozesebwa okwekenneenya ebyetaago by’okutendekebwa n’okukola enkola enzijuvu, ey’okuzimba obusobozi mu bbanga eggwanvu."

Strong opportunities for double-duty actions include the following examples: school feeding programmes that focus only on addressing undernutrition or overweight can be redesigned to ensure that they instead provide and promote a healthy diet; scaling up the WHO antenatal care recommendations; protecting and promoting breastfeeding; revising complementary feeding guidelines and educating care-givers on the risks of unhealthy complementary foods; designing social support and welfare programmes to reduce risks from unhealthy foods; and ensuring that food systems and food environment policies facilitate the purchase and consumption of a healthy diet by increasing access to and attractiveness of nutritious foods.,Emikisa egy’amaanyi egy’ebikolwa eby’emirundi ebiri mulimu ebyokulabirako bino wammanga: Enteekateeka z’okuliisa amasomero ezissa essira ku kukola ku by’okulya ebitali birungi oba omugejjo gwokka bisobola okuddamu okukolebwa okulaba nti mu kifo ky’ekyo biwa n’okutumbula endya ennungi; Okulinnyisa ebiteeso by’okulabirira abaana nga tebannazaala; okukuuma n’okutumbula okuyonsa; okuddamu okutunula mu ndagiriro z‟okuliisa ezijjuliza n‟okusomesa abalabirira ku bulabe bw‟emmere etali nnungi ejjuliza; okukola enteekateeka z‟obuyambi bw‟abantu n‟obulungi bw‟abantu okukendeeza ku bulabe obuva mu mmere etali nnungi; n’okulaba ng’enkola z’emmere n’enkola z’obutonde bw’ensi ziyamba okugula n’okukozesa emmere ennungi nga bongera okufuna n’okusikiriza emmere erimu ebiriisa.

"This understanding of disability is grounded in the WHO International classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF), published in According to the WHO Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities, approximately 1.3billion persons in 2021  about 16% of the global population  had disability.","Okutegeera kuno ku bulemu kwesigamiziddwa ku kitongole ky‟ensi yonna eky‟ensi yonna eky‟emirimu, obulemu n‟ebyobulamu (ICF), ebifulumizibwa mu okusinziira ku lipoota ya WHO ey‟ensi yonna ku by‟obulamu eri abantu abaliko obulemu, abantu nga 1.3 mu mwaka gwa 2021 nga 16% ku bantu mu nsi yonna baalina obulemu."
The global number of persons with disabilities has increased substantially in the past decade due to demographic and epidemiological changes such as population growth and the increase in the number of persons with NCDs who are living longer and ageing with limitations in functioning .,Omuwendo gw'abantu abaliko obulemu mu nsi yonna gweyongedde nnyo mu myaka kkumi egiyise olw'enkyukakyuka mu bungi bw'abantu n'obulwadde bw'ensi nga okukula kw'abantu n'okweyongera kw'omuwendo gw'abantu abalina NCDs abawangaala n'okukaddiwa n'obuzibu mu kukola emirimu .

"The contributing factors to these inequities can be (i) health-system-related factors, such as barriers in physical infrastructure and communication, negative attitudes by health workers or lack of disability data in the health information system; (ii) structural factors, such as stigma and discrimination; (iii) social determinants, such as poverty and lack of education; and (iv) disease risk factors such as tobacco consumption and obesity.","Ensonga eziyamba ku butali bwenkanya buno ziyinza okuba (i) ensonga ezikwata ku nkola y’ebyobulamu, gamba ng’ebiziyiza mu bikozesebwa ebirabika n’empuliziganya, endowooza embi abakozi b’ebyobulamu oba obutaba na biwandiiko bya bulemu mu nkola y’amawulire g’ebyobulamu; (ii) ensonga z’enzimba, gamba ng’okuvumwavumwa n’okusosola; (iii) ebisalawo embeera z’abantu, gamba ng’obwavu n’obutasoma; ne (iv) ensonga eziyinza okuvaako endwadde nga okunywa taaba n’omugejjo."

Poverty is a solid example to demonstrate this.,Obwavu kyakulabirako kinywevu okulaga kino.
"Across European countries, 77.7% of persons with severe disabilities were at risk of poverty before social transfers (such as benefits, allowances and pensions), compared with 35.2% of persons with no disability.","Mu nsi za Bulaaya, abantu 77.7% abaliko obulemu obw’amaanyi baali mu bulabe bw’obwavu nga tebannaba kukyusa bantu (nga emiganyulo, ensako n’akasiimo), bw’ogeraageranya n’ebitundu 35.2% ku bantu abatalina bulemu."

"Box 4.4	 Intimate partner violence against women with disabilities A systematic review of 26 studies, mainly from high-income countries, concluded that the prevalence of all forms of IPV (including physical, psychological/emotional, sexual and financial) was higher among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities .","Bokisi 4.4 Okutulugunya kw’abaagalana okw’omukwano ku bakyala abaliko obulemu okwekenneenya okunoonyereza okutegekeddwa 26, okusinga okuva mu nsi ezirina ssente ennyingi, kwazuula nti obungi bwa IPV obw’engeri zonna (nga mw’otwalidde omubiri, ebirowoozo/enneewulira, eby’okwegatta n’eby’ensimbi) bwali bungi mu bakyala abaliko obulemu okusinga mu bakyala abatalina bulemu ."
Evidence is also emerging from low- and middle-income countries.,Obujulizi era buva mu nsi ezirina ssente entono n’eza wakati.
"For example, analysis of data from seven violence-prevention programmes in low- and middle-income countries indicated that women with disabilities were nearly twice as likely to report past-12-month IPV than women without disabilities .","Okugeza, okwekenneenya data okuva mu nteekateeka musanvu ez’okuziyiza effujjo mu nsi ezirina ssente entono n’eza wakati kwalaga nti abakyala abaliko obulemu baali kumpi emirundi ebiri okutegeeza IPV ey’emyezi 12 egiyise okusinga abakyala abatalina bulemu ."
"Current estimates are likely significant underestimates, as women with disabilities tend to be underrepresented in surveys and may also experience disability-specific types of violence that are often unmeasured.","Okubalirira okuliwo kati kuyinza okuba okw’amaanyi okunyooma, kubanga abakyala abaliko obulemu batera obutakiikirirwa bulungi mu kunoonyereza era bayinza n’okufuna ebika by’effujjo ebikwata ku bulemu ebitera obutali bulung’amya."
"For a better understanding of the risk factors for violence against women, and to enable the development of more specialized prevention strategies and response plans, it is necessary to improve the inclusion of women with disabilities and the issue of disability within violence against women in population-based surveys and research.","Okusobola okutegeera obulungi ensonga eziyinza okuleeta effujjo ku bakyala, n‟okusobozesa okukola enkola ez‟enjawulo ez‟okuziyiza n‟enteekateeka z‟okuddamu, kyetaagisa okulongoosa mu kussaamu abakyala abaliko obulemu n‟ensonga y‟obulemu mu kutulugunya abakyala mu kunoonyereza okwesigamiziddwa ku bungi bw‟abantu n‟okunoonyereza."
It is essential that the actions that governments take to advance disability inclusion in the health sector are informed by valid and reliable data that allow monitoring and tracking progress.,Kikulu nnyo nti ebikolwa gavumenti bye zikola okutumbula okuyingiza obulemu mu kitongole ky’ebyobulamu bitegeezebwa ebikwata ku nsonga entuufu era ebyesigika ebisobozesa okulondoola n’okulondoola enkulaakulana.

"Factors contributing to the inequity are frequently not well captured, making it difficult sometimes to explore the drivers of the differences and whether these differences are indeed due to unjust or unfair factors.","Ensonga eziviirako obutali bwenkanya emirundi mingi tezikwatibwa bulungi, ekikaluubiriza oluusi okunoonyereza ku bavuzi b’enjawulo n’okumanya oba ddala enjawulo zino ziva ku nsonga ezitali za bwenkanya oba ezitali za bwenkanya."
The collection of data on disability is often deprioritized in many countries; consequently the evidence of health inequities and their contributing factors is more limited than for other groups in marginalized situations.,Okukung’aanya ebikwata ku bulemu kutera okuggyibwako mu nsi nnyingi; N’olwekyo obujulizi bw’obutali bwenkanya mu by’obulamu n’ensonga ezibayamba bukoma okusinga ku bibinja ebirala mu mbeera eziteekeddwa ku mabbali.
"However, lack of evidence should not be interpreted as a lack of inequities.","Kyokka, obutaba na bujulizi tebulina kutaputibwa ng’obutaba na butali bwenkanya."
"There is a fundamental need to collect or disaggregate population- and facility-based data based on disability status, across the different levels of country health information systems.","Waliwo obwetaavu obukulu obw‟okukung‟aanya oba okwawulamu ebikwata ku bungi bw‟abantu n‟ebifo okusinziira ku mbeera y‟obulemu, mu mitendera egy‟enjawulo egy‟enkola z‟amawulire agakwata ku bulamu bw‟ensi."
"For example, at input level, administrative sources such as financial tracking systems, databases and records on human resources, infrastructure or policies can be used to understand how financing for disability works, or whether health facilities are accessible.","Okugeza, ku mutendera gw’okuyingiza, ensonda z’obufuzi nga enkola z’okulondoola eby’ensimbi, ebifo ebitereka amawulire n’ebiwandiiko ebikwata ku bakozi, ebikozesebwa oba enkola bisobola okukozesebwa okutegeera engeri ensimbi z’obulemu gye zikolamu, oba oba ebifo by’ebyobulamu bituukirirwa."

More actions were taken towards improving access to health services among persons with disabilities.,Ebikolwa ebisingawo byakolebwa okutumbula okufuna obuweereza bw‟ebyobulamu mu bantu abaliko obulemu.
"In addition, a decision was taken to include disability questions in the countrys National Health Survey to enable the government to better track progress and understand unmet service needs among persons with disabilities.","Okugatta ku ekyo, kyasalibwawo okussaamu ebibuuzo by’abalema mu kunoonyereza ku by’obulamu mu ggwanga okusobozesa gavumenti okulondoola obulungi enkulaakulana n’okutegeera ebyetaago by’obuweereza ebitannaba kutuukirizibwa mu bantu abaliko obulemu."

New and renewed emergencies are straining health services in all WHO regions.,Ebipya n’ebipya eby’amangu binyigiriza obuweereza bw’ebyobulamu mu bitundu bya WHO byonna.
"In addition to deaths and injuries, the risks of infectious diseases and mental health conditions also increase; meanwhile health facilities may be unable to cope as they are heavily affected by power and supply outages, or even targeted in conflicts.","Ng’oggyeeko okufa n’okulumwa, obulabe bw’endwadde ezisiigibwa n’embeera z’obulamu bw’omutwe nabwo bweyongera; Mu kiseera kino ebifo by’ebyobulamu biyinza obutasobola kugumira mbeera eno kuba bikosebwa nnyo amasannyalaze n’okusaasaanya amasannyalaze, oba n’okutunuulirwa mu ntalo."
"The threat of malnutrition and starvation exists further down the line as a result of disrupted food supplies, exacerbating critical health needs of already vulnerable Although a large proportion of refugees and migrants are in generally good health, their numbers also include children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and those whose health has been negatively impacted by their travels or the circumstances in their home country.","Okutiisibwatiisibwa endya embi n’enjala kweyongera okukka wansi nga kiva ku mmere etaataaganyizibwa, ekyongera ebyetaago by’obulamu ebikulu eby’abaali mu bulabe obwaliwo edda wadde ng’ekitundu ekinene eky’ababundabunda n’ababundabunda okutwalira awamu bali mu bulamu bulungi, omuwendo gwabwe era gulimu abaana, abakadde, abantu abaliko obulemu, n’abo obulamu bwabwe obubadde bukosa nnyo entambula zaabwe oba embeera mu nsi yaabwe mu maka gaabwe."
"These health needs transcend national boundaries, but many countries restrict health coverage based on immigration status, limiting access to health insurance and services, and the cost of non-emergency care may be an unaffordable out-of-pocket expense.","Ebyetaago bino eby’obulamu bisukka ensalo z’eggwanga, naye amawanga mangi gakugira okusasulwa kw’ebyobulamu okusinziira ku mbeera y’okuyingira mu ggwanga, okukomya okufuna yinsuwa y’ebyobulamu n’obuweereza, era ssente z’okulabirira okutali kwa mangu ziyinza okuba ensaasaanya etali ya ssente."
"These factors leave millions in vulnerable situations globally, and they may encounter poorer health outcomes, particularly in substandard living and working For instance, studies have found higher rates of anaemia in women and children among refugees and migrants compared with local populations, and there is an increased risk of both anaemia and malnutrition in some camp-based settings .","Ensonga zino zireka obukadde n‟obukadde mu mbeera ezitali nnungi mu nsi yonna, era ziyinza okusanga ebiva mu bulamu ebibi naddala mu bulamu obutali ku mutindo n‟okukola okugeza, okunoonyereza kuzudde nti emiwendo gy‟okukendeera kw‟omusaayi mu bakyala n‟abaana mu babundabunda n‟ababundabunda mu nsi yonna bwe bageraageranya n‟abantu b‟omu kitundu, era waliwo obulabe obw‟okwongera obw‟okukendeera kw‟omusaayi n‟endya embi mu bifo ebimu ebisinziira ku nkambi ."
"Migrant workers may face discrimination, exploitation, limited workplace rights and social protection, as well as significant occupational health problems, such as higher risk of occupational injuries documented particularly among male migrant workers employed in high-risk industries .","Abakozi ababundabunda bayinza okwolekagana n‟okusosolwa, okukozesebwa, eddembe ly‟okukolera ku mirimu ettono n‟okukuuma embeera z‟abantu, wamu n‟ebizibu ebinene eby‟obulamu ku mirimu, gamba ng‟obulabe obw‟amaanyi obw‟okufuna obuvune ku mirimu obuwandiikiddwa naddala mu bakozi abasajja ababundabunda abakozesebwa mu makolero agali mu bulabe obw‟amaanyi ."

"In addition, refugees and migrants may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of AMR during various phases of migration and displacement, due to factors such as exposure to infections, limited access to diagnostics and therapeutics and inappropriate use of Distribution of access to government health services for refugees and migrants across 84 countries, Access to all services emergency healthcare services only Proportion of countries (%) Source: WHO , based on unpublished data from the International Organization for Migration.","Okugatta ku ekyo, ababundabunda n’ababundabunda bayinza okuba nga bazibuwalirwa nnyo ebiva mu AMR mu biseera eby’enjawulo eby’okusenguka n’okusengulwa, olw’ensonga ng’okukwatibwa endwadde, okufuna okutono mu kuzuula obulwadde n’obujjanjabi n’okukozesa obubi ensaasaanya y’okufuna empeereza z’ebyobulamu bya gavumenti eri ababundabunda n’ababundabunda mu nsi 84, okufuna empeereza zonna ez’amangu ez’ekitongole ky’ebyobulamu kyokka eky’amawanga (%)"
"Yet, data on health-care access policies from 84 countries between 2018 and 2021 show that only half of them provide refugees and migrants with access to all government-funded health services under the same conditions as nationals, regardless of migratory status Available evidence reveals mixed patterns of NCD burden and risks among migrants and refugees compared with host populations.","Naye, ebikwata ku nkola z’okufuna obujjanjabi okuva mu mawanga 84 wakati wa 2018 ne 2021 biraga nti kimu kya kubiri kyokka ku byo kye kiwa ababundabunda n’ababundabunda okufuna empeereza zonna ez’ebyobulamu eziweebwa gavumenti mu mbeera ze zimu n’abantu b’eggwanga, awatali kufaayo ku mbeera y’okusenguka obujulizi obuliwo bulaga enkola ezitabuliddwamu ez’omugugu gwa NCD n’akabi akali mu babundabunda n’ababundabunda bwe bageraageranya n’abantu abakyaza."
"Taking cancer as an example, studies from three high-income countries in the Americas suggested better outcomes for migrants with cancer, whereas research from two high-income European countries indicated that cancer was often diagnosed at advanced stages among refugee and migrant populations, leading to poorer health outcomes than host populations .","Okutwala kookolo ng’ekyokulabirako, okunoonyereza okuva mu nsi ssatu ezirina ssente ennyingi mu Amerika kwalaga ebivaamu ebirungi eri ababundabunda abalina kookolo, so ng’ate okunoonyereza okuva mu mawanga ga Bulaaya abiri agafuna ssente ennyingi kwalaga nti kookolo yatera okuzuulibwa ku mitendera egy’oku ntikko mu bantu ababundabunda n’ababundabunda, ekivaako ebiva mu bulamu obubi okusinga ebikyaza ."
"These challenges are mirrored in other regions, with refugee and migrant women facing barriers to HPV vaccination in settings where factors such as accessibility and physician recommendations play significant roles (60, 61).","Okusoomoozebwa kuno kulabika mu bitundu ebirala, ng’abakyala ababundabunda n’ababundabunda boolekedde ebiziyiza okugema HPV mu mbeera ng’ensonga ng’okutuuka ku bantu n’okuteesa kw’abasawo zikola kinene (60, 61)."

"Migrants were also 1.7 times as likely to have material and social deprivation (defined as not being able to afford certain goods, services and social activities), twice as likely to be overburdened by housing costs as a portion of their income and 2.6 times as likely to be living in overcrowded conditions.","Ababundabunda era baali emirundi 1.7 nga batera okuba n’ebintu n’okubulwa embeera z’abantu (ebitegeezebwa nti tebasobola kwesasulira bintu ebimu, obuweereza n’emirimu gy’embeera z’abantu), emirundi ebiri okusinga okuzitoowererwa ssente z’amayumba okusinga ekitundu ku nfuna yaabwe n’emirundi 2.6 egy’okubeera mu mbeera esukkiridde."

"For example, the proportion of people reporting a long-standing illness or health problem is more than 10percentage points higher among migrants compared with non-migrants in seven countries, but is more than 10percentage points higher among non-migrants in six other countries.","Okugeza, ekitundu ky’abantu abaloopa obulwadde oba ekizibu ky’ebyobulamu ekibaddewo okumala ebbanga kiri waggulu ebitundu ebisukka mu 10 ku buli 100 mu babundabunda bw’ogeraageranya n’abatali basenguka mu nsi musanvu, naye nga kisingako ebitundu ebisukka mu 10 ku buli 100 mu bantu abatali basenguka mu nsi endala mukaaga."

"For example, the prevalence of tobacco smoking was over 5percentage points higher among migrants in four countries, but over 5percentage points higher among non-migrants in six countries.","Okugeza, obungi bw’okunywa sigala bwali waggulu ebitundu ebisukka mu bitundu 5 ku buli 100 mu babundabunda mu nsi nnya, naye ebitundu ebisukka mu bitundu 5 ku buli 100 mu batali basenguka mu nsi mukaaga."

Data-driven approaches are vital for fostering health equity and social inclusion.,Enkola ezikulemberwa amawulire kikulu nnyo mu kukuza obwenkanya mu by’obulamu n’okuyingiza abantu mu mbeera z’abantu.
"Since the Global Action Plan is founded on health issues for refugees and migrants, such data and the resulting monitoring will also contribute to the health-related SDGs for the population on the move, in particular refugees and migrants worldwide.","Okuva enteekateeka y’okukola ey’ensi yonna bwe yeesigamiziddwa ku nsonga z’ebyobulamu eri ababundabunda n’ababundabunda, ebikwata ku bantu ng’ebyo n’okulondoola okuvaamu era bijja kuyamba ku SDGs ezeekuusa ku by’obulamu eri abantu abali ku mugendo naddala ababundabunda n’ababundabunda mu nsi yonna."
"In response to the urgent need for evidence on the health status and needs of refugees, Statistics Poland collaborated closely with WHO at country, regional and approach was adopted in the border provinces of Poland, through a representative household survey and behavioural insights research, initiated in 2022, and repeated in 2023.","Mu kwanukula obwetaavu obw’amangu obw’obujulizi ku mbeera y’obulamu n’ebyetaago by’ababundabunda, ebibalo Poland yakolagana bulungi ne WHO ku nsi, ekitundu n’enkola byayisibwa mu masaza g’ensalo za Poland, okuyita mu kunoonyereza okukiikirira amaka n’okunoonyereza ku nneeyisa, okutandikibwawo mu 2022, era ne kuddibwamu mu 2023."
The results are illustrated in Fig.,Ebivuddemu biragiddwa mu kifaananyi.
"Even though services were rapidly made available for them, the European Union directive that allowed such provision does not necessarily address barriers to access, and hence barriers such as language and cultural differences and lack of information hindered and continue to hinder health-care access.","Newankubadde nga obuweereza bwaweebwa mangu, ekiragiro ky’omukago gwa Bulaaya ekyakkiriza enteekateeka ng’eyo tekitegeeza nti kikwata ku biziyiza okuyingira, era nga muno mwe muva ebiziyiza ng’enjawulo mu lulimi n’obuwangwa n’obutaba na mawulire galemesa era gagenda mu maaso n’okulemesa okufuna obujjanjabi."
