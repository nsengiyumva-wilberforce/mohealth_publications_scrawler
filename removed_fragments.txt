Annual Pharmaceutical Services Performance Report The reconciliation aimed to compare reports from NMS/JMS on delivered health commodities with records from the receiving health facilities.
It also assessed the consistency between stock issued from health facility stores to user and utilized.
Findings from the assessment indicated that 89% of commodities delivered matched the quantities received as per delivery notes.
"Untimely delivery of medicines, particularly in Cycles 3 and 4 of FY 2023/24, led to stock-outs in several facilities."
"Overall accountability at both store and user with Implanon having the highest accountability at 70%, while examination gloves had the lowest at 39%."
"Among the regions, Acholi demonstrated the highest level of accountability adherence, whereas Karamoja had the lowest at 32%."
"Key reasons for accountability failures included: poor documentation-records not tallying (59%), poor documentation -issuing stock without recording on stock cards (33%), no feasible explanation for discrepancies (6%), and suspicious theft, negligence, or wastage (2%)."
"This covered seven  health commodities namely Implanon NXT, Jadelle, Hormonal IUD, Sayana Press, Depo Provera, Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) and Syringe 1ml."

"Digitizing Commodity Ordering Prior to FY2023/24, health facilities placed commodity orders to NMS and JMS through various methods, including Excel sheets, scanned copies, DHIS2 (WAOs), and others."
This lack of standardization made order tracking and monitoring difficult.
"This portal allows health facilities to place orders directly with their designated warehouses, ensuring a more streamlined and efficient The new systems incorporate built-in order timeliness tracking, alerting users about upcoming deadlines."

"USAID/Strengthening Supply Chain Systems activity (SSCS) and other partners provided technical guidance on system performance, including training of the users, and monitoring uptake, applying lessons learned from digitization of ordering at NMS."
"By , all accredited private sector health facilities (PNFPs and PFPs) had been fully transitioned to place all their program orders through the JMS Integrated Ordering system (JMS-IOS)."
"As a result of this digitalization, average ordering rate for PNFP facilities increased from 69% in FY 2022/23 to 95% in FY 2023/24 (N=1004) for both program and non-program commodities."

Dr Baganizi Michael
Program Manager UNEPI
"In Uganda, Big Catch-up vaccination was conducted through regular routine immunization service delivery (fixed, outreach, mobile, school-based), periodic intensification of routine immunization (PIRI) activities,  that ensure individuals have the opportunity to receive routine immunizations for which they are overdue and Big catch up targeted Reaching children who missed vaccination during the period , which was partly due to COVID pandemic, and provide all missing vaccinations Due to the impact of COVID 19 restrictions, the Uganda noted accumulation of zero dose and under immunised children."
"As of 2023, the program had registered  zero dose children."
"Additionally, due to suboptimal performance of new vaccines especially in the  second Year of Life (2YL) during the year 2023, the program had only achieved 21% MR2 coverage below the target of 95%."
"Out of the targets for MR1, we reached  (96%)."
"Out of the  targets for MR2, we reached Uganda has indeed made significant strides in improving its immunization coverage, particularly through initiatives like ""big catch-up""."

"Challenges during Big catch up (By Pillar) Program Management and Finance Competing Priorities/ activities in the districts: The overlap of the campaign with other health interventions and community programs like the OPM assessment,Mpox outbreak activities stretched available resources especially the human resource and created scheduling conflicts and delays in the implementation of the activity."
Integration of services continues to challenge the HR available for the exercise.
"The BCU incorporated Praziquantel administration in 75 districts from the program of Neglected Tropical Diseases, Surveillance Vitamin A and Deworming administration and other Maternal child health services Some regions had minimal or no support by regional Implementing partners to facilitate /support the The first week had PLE examinations which affected some activities and vaccination in schools."
"Heavy rainfall disrupted outreach activities, making roads impassable and delaying vaccine transportation The late start of daily outreach sessions by the vaccination teams affected the utilization and uptake of Vaccination teams faced significant challenges of tracing vaccination records for children, girls and WCBA who had already received one or more doses of the eligible vaccine records."
This lack of accurate record-keeping often resulted in target groups receiving multiple doses of the vaccines.
"Fatigue of health workers and DHTs from multiple vaccination exercises and other competing priorities hampered readiness in certain areas causing delays in implementation Inadequate stock of some essential supplies and vaccines ( Hep B, HPV, Vit A and Dewormers) affected uptakes despite the demand  created."

"Pockets of vaccine hesitant parents/Caretakers in some communities were preventing their children from attending school on vaccination days, with some families fleeing their homes upon seeing Misinformation and miscommunication among some anti vaxxers Monitoring and Evaluation Denominator challenges: Due to the dynamic nature of the populations, The populations from Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) is not reliable since it doesn't take care of the nomadic nature of the populations like Influx of  refugees, Security displacement, Cross boarder movements, Rural Urban migration, pastoral nomads etc."
this sometimes causes moving denominator causing over performance Inadequate Use of Data : Districts do not regularly use data to identify gaps that affect access and utilization of EPI services.
"Inadequate data use affects planning, decision making, and resource mobilization."
"This impacted timely and accurate data recording, leading to potential gaps or inconsistencies in vaccination reports."
"Without the necessary tools, health workers faced challenges in documenting immunization activities effectively."
"These delays disrupted the availability of accurate and timely data, which in turn affected resource allocation, target setting, and overall immunization planning."

"The Standardisation Guide presents several digital health (DH) artefacts including; digital health Standards, digital health Enterprise Architecture Framework, digital health Workforce Capacity Building Framework, and digital health Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (DH-ASK)."
The DH-ASK artefacts will be used to standardise digitally-enabled healthcare and services in Ugandas health system.
Standardisation of the DH-ASK artefacts was derived from the requirements of an exploratory landscape study for digital health in Ugandas Health System.
The landscape analysis provided an understanding of the challenges that impeded digital health standardisation and data-use-for-action in Ugandas health system.
"As such, adopting international digital health standards normally requires significant localisation to meet specific requirements of that country such as Uganda."
"Standardisation entails standards determination, implementation, compliance monitoring and review."
"Standardisation can be used to develop standards requirements for Ugandas digital health to address digital health challenges such as fragmentation/siloed (un-interoperable) systems, data duplication, security and privacy of The digital health Enterprise Architecture Framework aims to define the how and what different digital health resources work together to optimise the delivery of healthcare and services."
"The digital health Standards aim to provide common rules, principles, and guidelines for the use of various digital health interventions in Ugandas health system."

"As such, adopting international digital health standards normally requires significant localization to meet the specific requirements of a country such as Uganda."
"Standardisation entails; standards determination, implementation, compliance monitoring and review (Costello & Parker, 2020; ISO/IEC, 2019; Kim & Matney, 2018)."
"Standardisation can be used to develop standards requirements for Ugandas digital health to address digital health challenges such as fragmentation/siloed (un-interoperable) systems, data duplication, security and privacy of patients data."
"Standardising digital health in Uganda was motivated by an exploratory landscape analysis of the digital health in Ugandas Health System (Alunyu et al., 2021; Kiwanuka et al., 2021; Mo."
"H-Uganda, 2021), which provided an understanding of the challenges that impeded digital health standardisation and data-use-for-action in Ugandas health system."
The exploratory study used the HIV disease model to provide highlights of the state of the art for digital health conducted in Uganda on grounds that several global and local interventions (i.e.
"; Uganda Government and Development Partners) as well as enormous investments had been made to the resources for Ugandas HIV response, which places great emphasis on the use of datadriven approaches to facilitate decision-making ensuring appropriate interventions are implemented in relevant populations in the right way ."
"Principally, various, though duplicated and disintegrated data-driven digital health interventions have been developed in Uganda to manage the HIV epidemic."
"As such, patients health data continues to be fragmented, unsecure and lacks privacy due to sitting on several siloed/un-interoperable digital health systems."
"In other words, their integration into a coherent national integrated health information system for Uganda is currently challenging."
"Accordingly, achieving a coherent National Integrated Digital Health Information System for Uganda would require standardisation for all digitally-enabled healthcare interventions; this is to facilitate their proper implementations to support health information exchange (HIE) within and across Ugandas health system."
"To this end, the contents of this Standardisation Guide report on several digital health (DH) artefacts including; digital health standards, digital health Enterprise Architecture Framework, digital health Worker Capacity Building Framework, and the digital health Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (DHASK)."
"The DH-ASK artefacts aim to standardise digitally-enabled healthcare and services in Ugandas health system as stipulated in Ugandas Health Information and Digital Health Strategy (2020/21-2024/25), other aligned policies/plans including Ugandas National Development Plan III (2020/212024/25), Uganda Vision-2040; Health Sector Development Plan (2020/212024/25) on digital health development and implementation in Uganda; WHO global strategy on digital health () where standardising digital health is among the primary health systems strengthening building blocks; UN-SDG 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, one of its targets being elimination of epidemics related to infectious diseases."
SECTION 1: DIGITAL HEALTH ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
This integrated view identifies and communicates the necessary improvements to business processes and IT assets to optimise an organisations mission capabilities and resource utilization.
"EA, therefore, translates an organisation's vision and strategy into effective enterprise change by creating, communicating, and improving the key requirements, principles, and models that describe the enterprise's future state."
Uganda.
"This framework is intended to standardise the implementation of Digital Health across Ugandas health system by optimizing and transforming the often-fragmented processes, information, application systems, and technologies into an efficient and integrated environment supportive of Ugandas Health Information and Digital Health (HIDH) Strategy."
"The DHEAF, which comprises several components that work together, has been built on the foundations of the Uganda National e. Health Strategy (Mo."
"H-Uganda, 2016) and the Uganda HIDH Strategy 2020/21-2024/25."
"It is aligned with the Uganda e. Government Interoperability Framework (NITA-U, 2021), Uganda e-Government Interoperability Reference Architecture (Go."
"U, 2021a), and Government of Uganda e. Government Web Application Security Architecture Framework (Go."
"U, 2021b)."
This approach supports the alignment of the the digital strategies of the Government of Uganda.
DESCRIPTION OF DHEAF COMPONENTS
COMPONENT 1: DIGITAL HEALTH ARCHITECTURE VISION AND GOALS
Description of EA Vision
The Digital Health Enterprise Architecture Framework (DHEAF) for Uganda is anchored on The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) version 9.2 and uses the semantic model for systems architecture defined in IEEE standard.

by the DH initiative.
2022)
"Monitoring of programme inputs and activities answers whether the DH technology works, and it relates to the assessment of the feasibility of the DH implementation and the inputs for developing the initiative."
"Monitoring of DH outputs assesses how the users interact with the initiative, and it relates to the service output measures intended to capture and assess the immediate results of the DH initiative as well as the usability measures to help quantify how the users interact with it."
"Evaluation of DH outcomes help to ascertain how the DH improves programme processes and service delivery; and it captures the effect of the Digital Health implementation on programme service utilization outputs or the extent to which the clients use the programme service, and intermediate population-level outcomes."
"From a technical perspective, DH inputs affect the respective outputs and users experience, while the user experience/feedback informs the DH development process."
Feedback from end-user adoption and satisfaction rates loops around to further inform the DH development process and determines the quality of the technological inputs.
"This, in turn, affects the performance of the revised version of the DH system among end-users, making the technology development process iterative."

COMPONENT 7: DIGITAL HEALTH SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
systems in Uganda.
Privacy relates to the metadata that allows for geo-positioning of the digital health solution when in use.
Confidentiality relates to the obligation of the digital service provider or other third-party user to protect the disclosure of either the content or metadata without explicit permissions from the client.
"Security relates to adoption and application of reasonable, technical and organisational measures to prevent loss, damage or unauthorised destruction and unlawful access to processing of the personal data."
SABSA is
"a framework and methodology for enterprise security architecture and service management, and it integrates freely with TOGAF, the foundational framework for the Digital Health Enterprise Architecture Framework."
"The DHISA comprises three main components that support each other to realize Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of health information."
1.
Security requirements drive the development of a Health organisations security governance as well as the entire security program.
Risk management  this is the process of determining the acceptable level of security risk at various points in the health organisations DH system and implementing the optimal level of management and technical control.
It grants power to entities needed to implement and enforce security and provides a way to verify the performance of these necessary security activities.
"They include; Asset management  a component and process for maintaining the inventory of hardware and software assets required to support device administration, compliance monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and other elements of security operations."
Administration  the process for securing the organisations operational digital assets against accidental or unauthorised modification or disclosure.
"Event management  the process for the day-to-day management of the securityrelated events generated by a variety of devices across the operational environment, including security, network, storage, and host devices."
"Vulnerability management  the process of identifying high-risk infrastructure components, assessing their vulnerabilities, and taking the appropriate actions to control the level of risk to the operational environment."
"Compliance  the process of ensuring that the deployed technology conforms to the organisations policies, procedures, and architecture."
2.
"All policies, standards, architectures, designs, operations, and other components of"
conceptual

and
design/development.
"The framework comprises; the security policy (that defines acceptable use, technical controls, management standards and practices), audit policy (that specifies what needs to be audited), processes (organisation processes around security, procedures needed to protect valued assets), and regulatory compliance (that stipulates acceptable regulatory and security compliances)."
3.

environment. It entails;
specific conceptual services.
Identity management services  responsible for assigning and maintaining digital identities and associated attributes across the electronic computing environment and for deleting identities when they no longer represent valid users of the environment.
b.
Logical Architecture  identifies discrete logical services and their relationships at the level required to determine what the health organisation needs to build or buy to construct a set of identity management services for the digital health Human resource system  provides administrative feeds to create or update internal user identities in the internal entities directory.
External identity administration system  creates or updates external user identities in the external entities directory on behalf of affiliated enterprises.

"d. Design and Development  these identify the types of guidance that organisations may want to provide to those responsible for design, development, and deployment of applications."
components or applications built in-house as well as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) applications selected for integration.
4.
Security Operations  these define the processes required to support a policy driven security environment.
"This domain consists of two key processes major categories; one category comprises the administration, compliance, and vulnerability management processes required to ensure that the technology as deployed conforms to policy and provides adequate protection to control the level of risk to the environment; while the other category consists of the administration, event, and incident management processes required to enforce policy within the environment."
The security operations domain of Mo.
"They entail; Asset Management  a component and process for maintaining the inventory of hardware and software assets required to support device administration, compliance monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and other elements of security operations."
This requires that health organisations identify all assets associated with information and processing facilities and also define appropriate protection responsibilities.
ISO/IEC 27005 provides examples of assets that might need to be considered by health organisations when identifying assets.
Security Administration  the components and processes for securing the health organisations operational digital assets against accidental or unauthorised modification or disclosure.
Security administration comprises two primary sub-components namely; 1).
"Identity management (responsible for the creation, modification, and termination (inactivation or deletion) of digital identities, including the workflow process for managing both identity and access management information."
Device configuration (responsible for technical standards instantiation at the device level.

2.1. DATA AND INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS
Health Record (PHR).
"ensure that the patient (health) data collected, information processed, shared, and stored are in formats that support both semantic and syntactic interoperability."
"Data and interoperability standards include medical coding, data exchange and sharing standards."
"These comprise of six  dimensions; Patient Identification, Health Information Exchange Registries, Compliance, Management and Communication of Medical Imaging Data, Health Information Systems, Digitization of Health Information, and the crosscutting Security and Privacy for Data and Training and capacity building standards."
"These standards are contextualised from several resources including; the Uganda Protection and Privacy Act 2019, (HL7) Health Level Seven , (FHIR) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources  and (DICOM) Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (Greenwell & Salentine, 2018; Saripalle et al., 2019), (HL7 Service-Aware Interoperability Framework: Canonical Definition Specification, Release 2 Draft Standard for Trial Use ; HL7_FHIR_DCOM Standards, 2022), Interoperability Framework."

CONCLUSION
"Notwithstanding numerous benefits that can be realised from implementing Digital Health (DH) in Ugandas health system, lack of standardisation and non-interoperability have caused most DH interventions to remain isolated and uncoordinated; hence affecting data use and utilisation in healthcare and service delivery, decision-making and informing policy."
This Guide fills the gap by detailing what is needed to standardise Digital Health in Ugandas health system.
"Particularly, the Standardisation Guide provides a comprehensive set of Digital Health Enterprise Architecture, Standards, and Knowledge products (DH-ASK) guidelines, that if implemented as prescribed, can facilitate a sustainable Digital Health environment for Ugandas health system."
"Additionally, if standards for DH capacity building are implemented as prescribed, these can aid the production of competent DH practitioners that can; lead DH policy development, management and regulation; develop, implement and maintain DH systems; and proficiently use the deployed DH systems in Uganda."
"As such, supporting realisation of Mo."

of Medicine --
structured
and precise
Contextualisation of terminologies and medical codes follows a process as outlined in process.
The need drives stakeholders to study the national and international health system contexts to understand the opportunities and complexities of the specific terminology.
Understanding the national context will drive extraction of data sets and indicators from the national Health Information Systems.
The compiled terminologies will be validated with stakeholders and any revisions made if needed.
The final set of terminologies will then be housed in an online terminology server housed at the managed by a standards manager.

"This review synthesizes key insights from the event, focusing on factors contributing to diagnostic inaccuracies, systemic gaps, and actionable strategies for improvement."
"Methods: Using a qualitative synthesis approach guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ), we analyzed data from a hybrid webinar (210 participants) and a four-day medical camp (600+ patients served)."
"Thematic analysis identified four key areas: (i) factors influencing diagnostic errors, (ii) the role of laboratory and imaging services in diagnosis error prevention, (iii) existing health system interventions, and (iv) patient empowerment in the diagnostic process."
"Results: Diagnostic errors in Uganda stem from cognitive biases, systemic inefficiencies (eg, understaffing, inadequate equipment), and financial barriers in private healthcare."
"Strengthening laboratory capacity, digitizing health records, and enhancing provider-patient communication emerged as pivotal solutions."
"The improvement framework, and patient feedback mechanisms demonstrate progress but require scaling."
"Conclusion: Reducing diagnostic errors demands systemic reforms, technological integration, and collaborative stakeholder engagement."
Ugandas WPSD 2024 insights offer a model for similar low-resource settings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient safety.
"Keywords: diagnostic errors, patient safety, healthcare quality, Uganda, world patient safety day Accurate and timely diagnosis is the cornerstone of effective healthcare, yet diagnostic errors remain a leading cause of patient harm globally.1 In low-resource settings like Uganda, where systemic challenges such as workforce shortages, inadequate diagnostic infrastructure, and fragmented health systems persist, diagnostic inaccuracies contribute signifi cantly to preventable morbidity, mortality, and financial burdens.24 The 2024 World Patient Safety Day (WPSD) theme, Drug, Healthcare and Patient Safety 2025:Turyasiima et al."

"Improving Diagnosis for Patient Safety, underscores the urgency of addressing these gapsa call to action that aligns with Ugandas commitments to universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"Despite global advancements in diagnostic technologies, Ugandas healthcare system grapples with persistent challenges."
"Studies reveal that 52% of healthcare workers in central Uganda have witnessed or committed diagnostic errors, with misdiagnosis rates as high as 9.2% in inpatient settings."
"The consequences are dire: patients endure prolonged suffering, unnecessary costs, and eroded trust in healthcare systems, while providers face moral distress This review synthesizes evidence from Ugandas WPSD 2024 commemoration to: analyze systemic and cognitive factors driving diagnostic errors in resource-constrained settings, evaluate the role of laboratory/imaging services and existing interventions (for example, accreditation, digital tools) in mitigating errors and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, healthcare providers, and communities to enhance diagnostic safety."
"Our findings address a critical gap in literature by integrating frontline provider experiences, patient narratives, and policy insightsa perspective often missing in top-down assessments."
"By leveraging Ugandas WPSD platform, this review captures real-world challenges and solutions, offering a model for similar low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)."
"The rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and post-pandemic health system strains in Uganda amplify the need for accurate diagnostics.5 For healthcare providers, this review highlights training gaps and workflow ineffi ciencies; for policymakers, it identifies regulatory and infrastructural priorities (eg, electronic health records, equitable resource allocation)."
"By bridging research, policy, and practice, this review contributes to global patient safety agendas while offering locally adaptable solutions."
"Its urgency is underscored by the preventable human and economic costs of diagnostic errorsa challenge demanding immediate, collaborative action."
We conducted a systematic qualitative synthesis of evidence from Ugandas 2024 World Patient Safety Day (WPSD) commemoration activities and peer-reviewed literature on diagnostic errors in low-resource settings.
"This methodological approach combined:  thematic analysis of primary data from WPSD events and  a narrative review of existing Data Sources and Search Strategy Primary data were collected from: hybrid webinar proceedings (210 participants), field observations from a 4-day medical camp (600+ patients served), policy documents and presentations from Ugandas media transcripts and stakeholder reports."

"Systematic qualitative synthesis and literature review yielded four main themes: i) factors influencing diagnostic errors, ii) adequate laboratory and imaging services as a means to prevent diagnostic errors, iii) existing health system interventions aimed at reducing diagnostic errors, and iv) empowering patients and families to actively engage with their healthcare providers."
Each theme will be elaborated on in the following sections.
"errors, such as the failure to synthesize available evidence or utilize physical examination and test data effectively contribute significantly to misdiagnoses."
"Additionally, systemic flaws including communication breakdowns, inade quate access to medical records, and limited availability of specialists compound these issues."
"In Uganda, key structural issues that contribute to diagnostic errors exist including the inability to track patients and abnormal findings over time, insufficient recognition of critical symptoms (or red flags), and the lack of reliable quality measurement and feedback systems to assess diagnostic performance."
Additional structural concerns stem from pressures Diagnostic errors affect 1 in 10 patients globally; worse in LMICs due to resource gaps.
* Aligns with Ugandas challenges; justifies focus on systemic Singh et al 260% of diagnostic errors in LMICs linked to Supports our emphasis on lab accreditation and digitization 69.2% misdiagnosis rate in Ugandan due to staffing shortages.

"Further discussions revealed specific structural factors such as gender stereotypes in healthcare-seeking behavior, lower health literacy, cultural norms, delayed health-seeking behaviors, and the temporal context of night versus day, weekends versus weekdays).20 Notably, male patients frequently face misdiagnosis due to lower health literacy levels and a healthcare system that often prioritizes womens and childrens health."
"Leadership and governance challenges, including poor oversight and a lack of a patient safety culture, further exacerbate diagnostic errors."
The financing structure of Ugandas healthcare system plays a critical role.
The MOH Uganda emphasizes the importance of well-equipped medical laboratories through its national health laboratory services policy and strategic plan.
"Despite this, many of its public health facilities face diagnostic challenges due to inadequate funding, which undermines the quality of healthcare services."
"A survey revealed that many lower-level health centers (levels IIIIV) in Uganda lacked essential resources such as equipment, reagents, and rapid test kits for critical diagnostic tests, resulting in delays and diagnostic errors.24 To enhance access to laboratory services in Uganda healthcare, strategies like mobile labs and a hub system for transferring tests to higher-level facilities have been initiated."
"A significant number of laboratory errors arise from improperly completed request forms, often due to a lack of compliance with standard operating procedures and inadequate cooperation from lab staff."
"Additionally, experts stressed the importance of laboratory accreditation, standardization in testing procedures, proper documentation and interpretation of results, and effective communication between laboratory profes sionals, radiologists, and Drug, Healthcare and Patient Safety 2025:Turyasiima et al"

"Training for sample collectors could also minimize diagnostic errors caused by delays in reporting, as many test results remain pending for days."
"Existing Health System Interventions to Reduce Diagnostic Errors in Uganda During the commemoration events, health officials underscored the importance of collective efforts to improve healthcare quality."
"They emphasized active stakeholder engagement, including healthcare providers and patients, in refining the diagnostic process."
"including advanced technologies such as CT (computed tomography) scanners at Regional Referral Additionally, over 73 laboratories in government underscoring significant advancements in the quality of laboratory services."
"Ugandas patient referral systems facilitate the transfer of patients to higher-level care, ensuring access to qualified personnel and advanced diagnostic services at national referral The implementation of the 5S (sort, set, shine, standardize and sustain) at Uganda health facilities since 2010,29 with regular assessments for both public and private facilities have improved management practices at workplace as well as continuous quality improvement."
"Additionally, the Ministrys Client Satisfaction Feedback Initiative30 has allowed patients to report gaps in healthcare services directly, promoting patient-centered care and community engagement."
"In Uganda, medical training includes an intensive five-year program followed by a one-year supervised internship, preparing doctors to make accurate diagnoses using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD).31 To uphold high standards of care, healthcare professionals must annually earn continuous professional development (CPD) points for license renewal."
"Each instance of diagnostic errorwhether found through chart reviews or peer reportsshould be treated as an opportunity for analyzing the diagnostic process and implementing quality Blaming individuals for diagnostic errors is counterproductive, as errors are inevitable for all fostering open discussions and focusing on systemic improvements alongside individual skill development is essential for continuous improvement in diagnostics.9 Ministries of Health should prioritize minimizing diagnostic errors through effective interventions, collaboration with patients, healthcare workers, and leaders, and adherence to the principle of First, do no harm."
This approach promotes patient safety and cultivates accountability and excellence in healthcare.
"Empowering Patients and Families to Actively Engage with Their Health Care Patient empowerment emerged as the central theme of the WPSD 2024 commemoration in Uganda, as empowered patients play a crucial role in improving healthcare quality and reducing diagnostic errors."
"Experts emphasized the importance of seeking second opinions and ensuring patient access to medical records, among other strategies, to prevent misdiagnoses and promote greater patient engagement in healthcare."
The MOH Uganda has enhanced the human rights-based approach to provide health services.
These efforts promote access to medical information and encourage improved communication regarding treatment options.

"Despite these initiatives, challenges still exist particularly in ensuring diagnostic equipment availability, promoting patient responsibility for their health, maintaining confidentiality of patient information, and establishing a centralized information system for patient records to minimize diagnostic errors."
"Multi-Level Approaches for Improving Diagnostic Safety During the World Patient Safety Day 2024 commemoration in Uganda, discussions led to key recommendations for improving diagnostic safety in similar healthcare settings."
National Level Interventions The Ministries of Health must take the lead role by developing a comprehensive national patient safety framework and implementation plan that prioritizes diagnostic safety within the broader scope of patient safety and quality improvement initiatives.
A significant step forward would be the establishment of standardized mechanisms and incentives for healthcare providers to voluntarily report diagnostic errors.
accountability regarding adverse events during medical practice.
"In Uganda, previous efforts have primarily focused on enhancing patient safety culture in regional referral progress, technical teams at RRHs should expand their oversight to district general facilities through a structured regional supportive supervision system."

Following the implement these systems comprehensively across all health facilities.
"Regulation of Private Healthcare Practices To bolster patient safety within the broader healthcare ecosystem, improving regulation of private healthcare practices is necessary."
"The MOH must ensure adherence to patient safety standards in private facilities, preventing profit-driven motives from overshadowing patient care."
Collaboration across specialties helps reduce diagnostic errors and improves patient outcomes.
"Limitations and Future Research Recommendations This review provided a comprehensive qualitative synthesis of Ugandas diagnostic safety challenges by integrating insights from World Patient Safety Day 2024 with existing literature, offering context-specific analysis and policyrelevant recommendations grounded in established frameworks."
"While its multi-stakeholder approach and localized focus represent key strengths, limitations include reliance on self-reported data, limited generalizability, and lack of quantita tive metrics."
The 2024 World Patient Safety Day commemoration in Uganda has illuminated critical gaps and opportunities in diagnostic safety within resource-constrained settings.
"This review underscores that diagnostic errors driven by systemic inefficiencies, cognitive biases, and technological limitations are not inevitable but require deliberate, multi-level interventions."
"Ugandas progress in laboratory accreditation, digital health adoption, and community engagement offers a foundation for scalable solutions, yet challenges persist, particularly in private-sector regulation, workforce training, and equitable access to diagnostics."

"The proposed strategies ranging from national policy reforms (eg, mandatory error reporting systems) to localized actions (for example, patient empowerment campaigns) provide a roadmap for reducing diagnostic errors."
"Crucially, these recommendations align with global patient safety agendas while remaining adaptable to Ugandas unique context."
"For policymakers, this study highlights the urgency of investing in diagnostic infrastructure and governance; for healthcare workers, it stresses the need for continuous learning and teamwork; and for patients, it reaffirms their role as active partners in the diagnostic process."
"Moving forward, implementation research must test these interventions, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence and electronic health records in low-resource settings."
"By fostering collaboration among stakeholders and centering patient safety as a shared priority, Uganda can model transformative change for similar health systems worldwide."

"Uganda launched its COVID-19 vaccination program on , 2021, prioritizing high-risk groups such as individuals with comorbidities, people over 50 years of age, and essential workers (healthcare personnel, security forces, and teachers)."
The HBSSS was implemented in eight referral The evaluation aimed to assess the impact and feasibility of HBSSS as a vaccine safety surveillance model for low-income countries like Uganda.
"The evaluation focused on several key themes, including the implementation process, facilitators of HBSSS, benefits, feasibility, lessons learned, and recommendations."
"Findings indicated that AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization) reporting improved significantly during the HBSSS implementation period, increasing from 30 AEFI case reports per  doses to 85 AEFI case reports per  doses by 2023."
"Respondents attributed the success of HBSSS to several key factors, including training support, the availability of data collection tools, funding, experience sharing, motivated staff, and the commitment of dedicated Overall, the HBSSS was successfully implemented, and improved the effectiveness of the AEFI/AESI surveillance system in Uganda."
"To sustain these gains and enhance vaccine safety monitoring, we recommend providing additional resources to expand AESI surveillance to lower-level"

"Uganda registered its first Covid-19 case on 21st  (Kawuki, Sserwanja, Obore, & Tak Fai Lau, 2021)and by , there were over  Ugandans that had contracted the disease and 251 had died."
"On , 2021, COVID-19 vaccination started in Uganda Under Emergency Use Listing (EUL) with populations of high-risk groups that included; people with comorbidity, elderly above 50 years of age, essential workers (health workers, security personnel and teachers) to ensure reduced morbidity, mortality, and continuity of essential services."
The available Covid-19 vaccines included: Astra.
"Zeneca, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer and By 11th , most of the persons targeted in Phase 1 had at least received first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines."
"The adults 50 years and above numbering  (89%), had received their first dose and 44.6% received a second dose; a higher number of Health workers  (184.9%) turned up for first dose instead of an estimated , and  (106.1%) for the second dose;  (105%) teachers turned up compared to the estimated number of  for the first dose and (61%) for second dose compared to the recommended national target of 80% of the eligible population."
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through its Global Immunization Division, has supported Uganda with both technical expertise and financial resources to enhance its vaccine safety infrastructure."
"This collaboration contributed to the establishment of a functional national AEFI committee, which played a key role in advancing this work."
"Additionally, a comprehensive national system for monitoring AEFI and AESI was implemented in , to track the safety of the Novel Oral Polio Vaccine Type 2 of rare but serious adverse events of special interest (AESl) or to evaluate safety signals arising from other sources, following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in Uganda."
"The COVID-19 vaccine introduction in Uganda provided an opportunity to conduct active, sentinel surveillance for AESl to generate robust, standardized vaccine safety data to inform national decision-making and contribute to global understanding of the safety profiles of COVID-19 vaccines."
1.1.2    Primary Objectives The overall aim of the HBSSS was to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in Uganda in near real-time for pre-specified AESI conditions and to inform decision making in order to maintain public confidence in the

"The three countries represent three unique approaches to vaccine safety HBSSS implementation, with significant differences in data collection methods (paper-based vs. electronic medical records), electronic data collection platforms (DHIS2 vs. ODK), ability to generate background rates for AESI, sentinel site locations (urban vs. rural), available diagnostic capacities (tertiary vs. secondary facilities) staffing (use of existing facility staff vs hiring of a dedicated team), number and types of AESI conditions under surveillance, baseline safety surveillance functionality prior to implementation, and funding needed to support HBSSS implementation."
"Given the rapid nature of vaccine introduction and urgent need to generate AESI data for in-country decision making, CDC-funded vaccine safety HBSSS projects which needed to be evaluated to understand their impact and feasibility for use as future vaccine safety surveillance approaches during new vaccine introduction or The evaluation adopted a cross sectional study design using qualitative methods and included a desk review to capture key safety indicators from the joint reporting forms."

"At the same time, people from lowincome countries, particularly women, continue to be largely excluded from leadership roles globally."
"A growing body of evidence backs-up this vital point.1 Companies with a greater proportion of women on their boards tend to outperform those with fewer women, with profitability being significantly higher."
"Diversity in leadership brings a variety of unique perspectives and skillsets to the table, enriching decision-making processes and innovation."

"As a leader in global health, Ihave experienced people reacting to my legitimate decisions in ways that Ihave found challenging and, at times, disrespectful."
"Allowing women to sit at a table laden with prejudice, bullying and blame is not progress."
We must not allow female leadership as an anomaly to become an aberration.

WORD
FROM THE
COLLECTIVE
A NEW REPORT AMIDST
PROGRESS AND PUSHBACK
"As we continue to advance the agendas of the groundbreaking Beijing and Cairo conferences on womens rights and population and development respectively, we see progress and pushback in equal measure."
This contest challenges us to reflect on our journey and enhance our strategies to bring about a more equitable and fairer world.
Our latest Report provides rigorous evidence highlighting the inequitable gender composition of boards governing global organisations active in health and the disproportionate influence of a few nationalities in these decision-making spaces.
The data feeds into the growing dialogue on power dynamics in global health: Who sets priorities and solutions?

"In fact, across the variables that we measure each year, we find progress  sometimes remarkable jumps  in organisational performance."
This link highlights the power of representation and the importance of fostering inclusive environments that encourage diverse leadership.
"The first GH5050 Report emerged during a period of intense advocacy for gender equality across political, professional, and personal spheres."
"Figures like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson amplify antifeminist rhetoric, which misrepresents gender equality and reinforces damaging stereotypes."
"This stance, often boosted by unchecked social media algorithms, promotes a harmful zero-sum perspective that pits mens interests against womens progress and sees women in power as about taking away, rather than adding value."
"The very term gender remains highly contested in global spaces, including increasingly in the World Health Assembly."
"We will continue to champion this cause with passion and urgency, recognising that our collective well-being and the realisation of the Sustainable Development Agenda depend on it."
"Swedish feminist foreign policy focused on rights, representation and resources."
"We add to that list a fourth R: recourse, in the sense of strengthened accountability for the first three Rs."
"Let us continue to push for progress, challenge inequities, and rewrite the rules on who gets to operate in the corridors of power."

"Yet exceedingly few employers analyse and publish their gender pay inequalities, particularly in the absence of state mandates."
"However, disparities remain substantial, particularly in bonus pay, where women receive a median 16.4% less than men."
"Lower lifetime earnings make it harder for women to save for retirement and result in smaller While there are promising signs of progress, the journey towards gender equality and equitable power distribution in global health is far from complete."
"Organisations must be held accountable for their commitments, and policies must translate into real-world outcomes.2 We encourage staff and stakeholders to use the findings of this Report to put pressure on leadership in organisations, particularly those that are performing poorly in the GH5050 Index (see Part 4 for how to use this Report to drive change)."

"organisations genderrelated policies and Every year, GH5050 shines a light on whether and how organisations are playing their part in addressing two interlinked dimensions of inequality: inequality of opportunity in career pathways inside organisations; and inequality in who benefits from the global health system."
"Parts 1 and 2 of this Report present our findings on the progress of organisations over seven years, including on public commitments to gender equality, workplace gender equality, diversity and inclusion policies, representation in leadership, and reporting data disaggregated by sex Part 3 offers opportunities to drive change using the results of the Report."
For the first time the GH5050 annual Report presents its findings separately for the nonprofit organisations and forprofit companies in our sample (see next page for the full list).
"The sample of for-profit companies included in the GH5050 analysis is largely derived from two groups: corporate participants in the Business and Health Action Group of the Global Business Council that provided a platform for the engagement of business in setting the health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and companies that contributed to consultations on the Uruguay Road Map on noncommunicable diseases."
"Such disaggregation also allows further insight into how the two types of employers perform differently across the Gender and Statistical analysis of data We undertook regression analyses to examine correlations between variables and tested for statistical significance, adjusting for confounders where appropriate."

"Through its annual Report and the Gender and Health Index, GH5050 assesses the gender-related policies and practices of global organisations (operational in a minimum of three countries) that aim to promote health and/or influence global health agendas and policy."
This sample has grown from 140 organisations assessed in 2018 to 201 in 2024.
Staff numbers range from four to half a million employees.
"GH5050 has taken a deliberative approach to identifying a broad and representative sample of organisations active in global health, including organisations based in low- and middle-income countries, for inclusion in its annual reports."

"This allowed the review to focus on diversity outcomes in the absence of policies that dictate geographical representation (i.e., distribution of seats by region) and/or that mandate single country representation (i.e., boards with seats reserved for government representatives only)."
"These exclusion criteria removed all United Nations organisations , all bilateral and multilateral organisations , and all regional bodies , and two  multilateral funding bodies from the larger sample."

"The board diversity policy sets the following criteria, which are considered essential: achieve a reasonable gender balance; have a broad range of nationalities and regions, including donor and beneficiary countries, with no more than three Directors from one country at any time, and have age diversity to bring different generational perspectives to the Boards deliberations."

"In yet another valuable report, Global Health 50/50 finds that women CEOs of nonprofits not only earn considerably less than their male counterparts but also control billions of dollars less in revenue."
This finding begs a conversation around ongoing systemic bias within the non-profit sector that continues to favour male-led organizations with disproportionate amounts of financial power and internal and external support.
"The recognition, reinforcement, and elevation of their leadership through equitable compensation, a strong Board of Directors partnership, and sustained and trust-based donor funding, make an important difference."

The gender pay gap provides a stark measure of power and privilege by comparing the average hourly pay of men and women in an organisation.
"Typically, the gap reflects the gendered distribution of employees across the levels of an organisationif an organisation has more men in senior positions and more women in lower-paid posts, it will have a wider Increasing transparency on pay gaps helps to ensure that employers are being fair and can be used to hold them accountable for closing the gap."
Below we report on the gender pay gap of organisations from the GH5050 sample that reported their gender pay gap to UK authorities between 2017/18 and 2023/24.
The median gap ranged from -8% (in favour of women) to 30% (in favour of men).

Advancing diversity and inclusion requires and deserves the same kind of rigour and attention that we apply to our scientific activities.
We cannot continue to rely on an individuals good fortune or extreme effort to forge pathways to success.
"Rather, Iknow firsthand that building inclusive institutions and changing power dynamics requires systems-level change."
"It requires clear strategies of accountability and transparency; metrics of inclusion, diversity, and equity; tracking and evaluation, and tying metrics to institutional reward systems."
The GH5050 Report this year finds encouraging increases in the availability of gender equality and diversity and inclusion policies.
"Iurge leaders and staff to keep pushing  ensuring that these policies are championed by leadership, that they are made robust through metrics and tracking, regular review, holding supervisors accountable for fair, equitable, and inclusive behaviors, and that they are ultimately aimed at guiding transformative change."

defining gender
Gender definitions reflect the depth and breadth of an organisations understanding of power and equality and how that informs decision-making and practice.
"Definitions of gender also display core values and help to define responses to how people operate and relate to each other in the workplace, across the health sector and beyond."
GH5050 adopts the definition of gender provided by the World Health Organization as its starting point in assessing public definitions of gender.
"We also find continued misconceptions of what the term means  particularly confusion and conflation of gender to mean women, sexuality, biological sex, or gender identity."
"For example: The phrase lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex life populations includes sexual orientations (lesbian, gay, bisexual) along with gender identities (transgender)."
"This mixes concepts of gender (distribution of power in society, social roles and identities) with concepts of sexuality (attraction and sexual orientation)."
"This includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with being a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each other."
World Health Organization See further discussion from WHO on the term gender and its relationship with health here.

"We view gender power and gender norms as constructed in relationships among individuals and reinforced by societies and structures, and we strive to work in ways that overcome the gender binary and achieve equality."
Gender refers to the socially constructed roles and responsibilities of women and men.

"The gender lens is an integral element of effective equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) policies that guide organisations in recognising power relations and institutionalising practices for more inclusive and equitable workplaces which in turn deliver more effectively on the organisations mission."

"Hard-won gains towards more equitable career pathways are under threat, including rumblings of the demise of EDI, and reversals of policies that had been put in place to promote more inclusive societies."
"This year, some universities in the United States, Sciences and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, announced they would no longer require diversity statements in Proponents of this change argue that it maintains a focus on academic excellence rather than identity."
"This rollback on the policy of EDI statements is only one example of how organisations reflect and respond to broader shifts in public discourse  and highlights how quickly policy reversals We are now living in a world of rising authoritarianism, conflict, and economic inequalities."
"Reversals of gender justice gains and shrinking civic space are evident, whether in Ugandas 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Bill, the US Supreme Courts 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, and in global fora such as the World Within gender justice movements, there are signs of divisions, rather than unity."
"We need to continue to advocate for structural changes, strong human rights frameworks, and against laws that divide groups and diminish rights, agency, and voice."
We need to hold systems of power to account for our collective rights.
"We need to continue the positive trends, and to be explicit about DEI through policies, conversations, action, and evidence of impact."

"Regional organisations We recognise the limitations of grouping organisations by sector, particularly considering the unique features of many in our sample that preclude distinct categorisation."
"At least two reviewers extract each data item independently, and a third reviewer verifies the data."
The reviewers discuss any discrepancies in data extraction until they reach a consensus.
"Aside from human resources policies, we do not ask for confidential information, information of a commercially sensitive nature or information that would identify individuals in organisations."
Several variables assess the availability and contents of policies.
We do not consider newsletters or blogs as evidence of policy.
"Further, for workplace-related policies, we do not consider the contents of job advertisements as evidence of policy, rather, we look for evidence of actual policies or an overall commitment from the organisation."
"In these cases, we used the same code as for the host/parent."
"For example, several organisations employ the workplace policies of the World Health Organization (WHO), e.g., Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health and the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research."
"Other nonworkplace policy variables (e.g., gender parity in leadership, stated commitment to gender equality, etc.)"

WHO/Lindsay Mackenzie
Global report on neglected tropical diseases 2024 Three full years have passed since the launch of the road map for neglected tropical diseases .
"In 2022, 1.62 billion people required interventions against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)."
"Although this reflects a 26% decrease from 2010, it does not provide the required trajectory to attain the road maps global target of a 90% reduction by 2030."
"Challenges persist, and the slow progress highlights the complexities of addressing NTDs on a global scale."
"Uncertain and evolving health, political and financial landscapes contribute to the difficulties in meeting the ambitious targets set in the road map."
"At the same time, it underscores the need for additional innovative efforts to include new countries and address more diseases within this group."
The road map introduced cross-cutting indicators to monitor health system capacities and the political environment for combatting NTDs.
"To address the inherent data gaps, in 2023 WHO introduced the Global NTD Annual Reporting Form (GNARF)."
"This exercise exposed challenges in the implementation of action related to several basic indicators as well as information system barriers that affect the data quality of As of end 2022, data record an increase (+22%) in reported deaths from vector-borne NTDs (as compared with 2016), a gradual scale-up of the adoption and implementation of integrated skin-NTD strategies (11 countries), of the development of guidance for management of NTD-related disabilities (19 countries), of integration on NTDs in national health plans (28countries), of inclusion of NTD interventions in Sudan: Conducting community health dialogues in a local village."

"packages of essential services (6 countries), of data reporting on all NTDs (32 countries), and of collecting and reporting gender-disaggregated data (17 countries)."
"In 2023, progress was also made under the three road Pillar 1 focuses on accelerating programmatic action."
"Medicine donation programmes achieved significant milestones in 2023, delivering 2.1 billion tablets and vials, million more than in 2022. WHO and partners are actively working to strengthen the arsenal of medicines and diagnostics, and to make the supply of donated NTD medicines and provision of NTD services more effective and efficient in reaching those in need, through gender, equity and human rights sensitive approaches."
"The offer of capacity strengthening tools was also broadened, with 62 online courses and other products available on WHO online platforms."
"Advocacy events carried out in 2023 included the Global NTD Programme Partners Meeting and the Reaching the Last Mile Forum, which raised the visibility of NTDs in the global health agenda and increased resource mobilization."
"The year 2023 also saw the inclusion of noma in the list of NTDs, and the mention of these diseases in two UN Pillar 2 addresses intensifying cross-cutting approaches, emphasizes integration across NTDs, cross-sectoral collaboration and mainstreaming of NTDs into health systems."
"The National Bridging Workshop on Rabies (NBW-R) was piloted as a tool to increase One Health collaboration for rabies control, while the Global Arbovirus Initiative together with the Global Vector Control Response provided a framework for expanding integrated vector management, especially in light of the growing public health threat represented by dengue."
Pillar 3 aims to change operating models and culture to facilitate country ownership.
Efforts made in included supporting countries in developing sustainability plans and facilitating the development of the third or more generation of national NTD master plans.
"Work carried out in 2023 to estimate the cost of specific NTD interventions or approaches will inform the costing of the road map operational plan for the period at global, regional and country levels, which in turn is expected to serve as an efficient tool to support Epidemiological and programmatic data for 2022, as well as facts and events that occurred in 2023, depict encouraging advancements and bottlenecks in the battle against NTDs."
"Challenges, ranging from a slow post-COVID-19 recovery to funding uncertainties, from geopolitical disruptions to climate change, from gaps in knowledge and tools to insufficient data, highlight the complexities inherent in addressing NTDs."
Addressing these challenges head-on and fostering innovative solutions will be critical in ensuring positive progress and sustained success in the global fight

"In 2023, six countries were acknowledged by WHO for eliminating one or more NTD, thanks to broad support from national and international stakeholders."
"This contributed to the attainment of a landmark achievement for global health at which 50 countries have now eliminated at least one NTD, bringing us to the halfway point towards the ambitious target set in the WHO NTD road map."
These milestones underscore the dedication and collaborative efforts of the health community in the fight against NTDs.

"Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) inflict significant physical, mental, economic and socioeconomic harm on over one billion people worldwide, mostly in tropical and subtropical areas."
"These diseases and disease groups1 maim, debilitate, disfigure and can be fatal."
"Buruli ulcer; Chagas disease; dengue and chikungunya; dracunculiasis; echinococcosis; foodborne trematodiases; human African trypanosomiasis; leishmaniasis; leprosy; lymphatic filariasis; mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses; noma; onchocerciasis; rabies; scabies and other ectoparasitoses; schistosomiasis; snakebite envenoming; soiltransmitted helminthiases; taeniasis and cysticercosis; trachoma; yaws."
NTDs cause immense human suffering.
"They affect some of the worlds most vulnerable people, who often live in remote communities, thereby creating NTD-related generational cycles of poverty that cost low- and middleincome countries billions of dollars every year ."
"To combat these diseases, NTD programmes continue to deliver vital interventions to some of the worlds hardestto-reach populations  often representing a communitys first entry point to a health system."
"Prioritizing NTD control, elimination and eradication efforts makes significant strides towards achieving broader global public health goals and development agendas and can be considered a tracer for equity in providing services and attaining universal health coverage."
This document is the second in a series of global reports describing progress towards the 2030 targets set in Ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals: a road map for neglected tropical diseases (the road map) .
"It describes a wide range of activities, accomplishments and challenges across the portfolio of NTDs and across all six WHO regions."
"In addition, it presents the main facts or events that occurred in 2023."
"In line with the road maps companion document Ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals: a framework for monitoring and evaluating progress of the road map for neglected tropical diseases (the M&Eframework) , the report includes quantitative information on the status of the overarching, crosscutting and disease-specific indicators."
This is followed by qualitative information on each of the three road map pillars and on regional and country progress.
"Global tools and platforms used to report data to WHO include the Global NTD Annual Reporting Form (GNARF), the Preventive Chemotherapy Joint Application Package (JAP), the Trachoma Evaluation and Monitoring Form (TEMF) and the WHO Integrated Data Platform (WIDP) for NTDs."

"With a renewed focus on strategic priorities addressing advocacy for action, partnership, costing and accelerated implementation, technical gaps including R&Dand leadership, we must intensify our collective action to address the deep-rooted inequalities that fuel the transmission of NTDs in the populations where they persist."
"From policy-makers to field teams who work to reach the most remote and inaccessible communities, each one of us must commit to play our respective roles to ensure the delivery of interventions against these diseases which in turn supports the much-needed progress towards universal health coverage, primary health care, health security and the Sustainable Development Goals."

"Cross-cutting indicator 1: Percentage reduction in number of deaths from vector-borne neglected tropical diseases (relative to 2016)  to achieve WHOs global vector control This indicator monitors the percentage reduction in the number of reported deaths from chikungunya, dengue and leishmaniasis in accordance with the Global Vector Control Response, adopted in 2017 through resolution WHA70.16."
The number of deaths related to vectorborne diseases increased by 22% in 2022 compared with2016.
"This is attributable to the increase in the number of dengue-related deaths by 27% compared with 2016, although there was a 25% reduction in the number of deaths related to visceral leishmaniasis compared with 2016."

"Progress under road map pillars Meeting the 2030 road map targets requires concerted action in areas built on strategic pillars to support global efforts to control, eliminate and The road map further describes strategic approaches needed to achieve these targets through cross-cutting activities that intersect to change operating models towards strengthening country ownership of NTD programmes."
Highlights of events and accomplishments 3.1 	 Pillar 1  Accelerate programmatic action Programmatic action has been accelerated for the areas identified under Pillar 1 of the road map.
"At its seventeenth meeting (Geneva, ), the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Neglect ed Tropical Diseases (STAG-NTD) discussed yaws eradication, One Health, the relationship between climate change and NTDs, and noma (also called cancrum oris or gangrenous stomatitis)."
"Recommendations aimed at advancing the global NTD agenda included the addition of noma to the list of NTDs, bringing the total number of conditions or groups of conditions to 21 (Box 3.1)."
Work has already started to facilitate the integration of noma in the road map and to foster collaboration between oral health and NTD programmes.
"These include an operational manual for vector control of both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis , a set of tools to facilitate the rollout of preventive chemotherapy for Taenia solium taeniasis , criteria and procedures for the Box 3.1."
"Support provided by WHO includes integrating noma prevention and control interventions into national health plans (including skin-NTD activities), and building capacities of primary care workers, oral health professionals and community actors to promote oral health and reinforce early detection and management of noma."
"Key partners and actors include Hilfsaktion Noma, Mdecins Sans Frontires, the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) located at the Centre for Tropical Medicine & Global Health of the nongovernmental organizations and patients associations."

Donations of medicines for treatment of NTDs represent one of the largest public health initiatives globally.
"In addition, two manufacturers donate two medicines to national authorities through other entities in support of three disease programmes."
"Between 2011 and 2023, over 27.7 billion tablets and vials of medicines have been delivered to countries for the implementation of NTD treatment interventions such as MDA and individual case management, through different donation mechanisms."
"In 2023 alone, approximately 2.1 billion tablets and vials were delivered, of which over 994 million were managed by WHO and made available to 112 Member States free of charge."
"Although these figures mark a significant increase from 2022, when only 1.9 billion and 781 million had been delivered to the same number of countries, they are still below pre-COVID-19 levels."
"Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic affected the entire supply chain management cycle for donated medicines, from submission of requests to production, from shipment to customs clearance to in-country distribution of medicines and reporting on their utilization."

"Implementation of the gap assessment to update the road map In 2019, WHO initiated an extensive qualitative consultation to identify the cross-cutting and disease-specific actions required to attain the road map targets and generate heat map colour rankings to signify the progress status of such actions (see Fig."
7 in the road map).
"That prototype process paved the way for the development of a refined methodology by the STAG-NTD Working Group on Monitoring, Evaluation and Research, called the gap assessment tool (GAT)."
The GAT is being implemented in the reporting period with the aim of updating the original heat map included in the road map.
Three inputs inform the gap assessments for the 20 groups of NTDs: (i) global NTD community and country online surveys; (ii) disease-specific focus group discussions; and (iii) dimension-specific (cross-disease) focus group discussions.
The GAT process is shown in the figure below.

Uganda - ensuring sustainable systems for combatting NTDs Ugandas NTD programming represents an important lesson for sustainability that could be replicated elsewhere.
"Uganda has initiated domestic resource mobilization, with three districts allocating budgets for NTDs."
Tracking financial and programmatic data from existing NTD interventions throughout the country accelerated understanding of local budgeting cycles and identified optimal entry points for periodic evidence-based advocacy.
Uganda plans to increase domestic financing of the total NTD budget from 12% in 2020 to 30% by 2025.
This will reduce dependence on donor support and boost the sustainability journey towards achieving the road map 2030 targets.
Monitoring existing programmes continues to build the evidence base to inform advocacy messaging.
Plans for further high-level engagement with key stakeholders such as the health parliamentary committee are under way to increase visibility and domestic funding for all NTDs of public health importance in Uganda.

Cross-cutting indicator6: Share of the population at risk protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure due to neglected tropical diseases level of financial protection globally and regionally does not change significantly (Fig.
A1.1).
A second approach to estimating the share of the population at risk protected against catastrophic out-ofpocket health expenditure due to NTDs involves using a fixed threshold rather than a proportion of expenditures.
The WHO Global Health Observatory provides two categories of additional information: (i)population pushed below the poverty line by household health expenditures (in %); and (ii) population (already below the poverty line) pushed further below the poverty line by household health expenditures (in %).

"how they are delivered at the health facility level, the way users interface with the EMRS, and how to continue to build for interoperability."
The human-centred design approach and analytical development methods will be used to understand the user requirements while considering the bottlenecks and challenges that users face.
The human-centred design takes a bottom-up approach and focuses on understanding an intervention's users or stakeholders.
While the analytical approach focuses on breaking down the process into the elements necessary to solve it and takes a top-down approach.
"An analytical approach will often require an expert mindset (consultant/technology firm) to collect information about how the intervention works in a linear, causal process."
"For the Public Sector, the Division of Health Information Management will lead the design and development process working with other relevant partners, Immunization, AIDS Control Program, Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program, Environmental Health For the Private Sector, health facility ownership will lead the design and development process following established guidelines and standard operating procedures."

6.0 Monitoring and Evaluating the Guidelines Monitoring and Evaluation is vital to ensure the successful implementation and smooth operation of EMRS.
"As part of Monitoring and Evaluation, quality assurance exercise shall run throughout the life cycle of the EMRS implementation, especially during installation and configuration of the EMRS infrastructure (software and hardware), training of staff on EMRS and deployment of the EMRS to ensure compliance with the national EMRS implementation guidelines."
6.1 Implementation Guideline Use Monitoring Monitoring the use of the Guidelines for Implementing the EMRS shall be based on a specific framework designed to track compliance and effectiveness.
"Therefore, the guidelines shall be monitored using three major parameters, namely, dissemination, training, and compliance."
"The guideline-use monitoring framework consists of the parameters or components, key monitoring questions, result statements, indicators, and means Dissemination: Refers to broadcasting the guidelines to a target audience through printed or electronic media such as print, electronic documents, or other forms of media as appropriate."
Copies of the guidelines shall be printed and distributed at national and sub-national levels.
The electronic copy of the guideline shall be uploaded on the Management Portal for public access and consumption.
Training: Refers to orienting and/or sensitizing key stakeholders on the key components of the guideline document including its value and their roles and responsibilities to ensure awareness and accelerate compliance.

verification.
"Compliance: Refers to the state of implementing the EMRS in accordance with established guidelines or standards, or the process of becoming so (compliant)."
Refer to Appendix Ifor a detailed Guideline-Use Monitoring Framework.
6.2 EMRS Deployment Monitoring The EMRS implementation is anchored within the overall Uganda Health Information and Digital Health Monitoring and Evaluation Framework.
This shall ensure optimization of EMRS implementation across board and foster successful evaluation efforts.
"Consequently, four  key parameters of EMRS deployment monitoring shall be considered, namely, functionality, stability, fidelity, and quality."
"Similar to guideline-use monitoring, the EMRS deployment monitoring framework shall consist of parameters or components, key monitoring questions, result statements, indicators, and means of Functionality: Refers to the degree to which EMRS provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions, or the ability of EMRS to support the desired intervention."
"For instance, the desired functionality of the EMRS application based on agreed upon user requirements."
Monitoring functionality shall be done pre- and postdeployment to ensure adequate system functionality at all times.
"Pre-deployment monitoring shall entail testing and providing feedback on various aspects including but not limited to skip patterns, validation checks, form schedules, form content, user interface design, data export/import functionality, data accuracy, and dashboard calculations."
timely decision-making.
"new users (e.g., a different cadre of health workers) and new geographic areas that might pose different levels of connectivity or when using new technologies."
Stability: Refers to the likelihood that EMRS functions shall not change or fail during use or the ability of EMRS to remain functional under both normal and anticipated peak conditions for data loads.
Monitoring stability shall be done concurrently with functionality monitoring both pre- and post-deployment.
"Considering that the EMRS heavily relies on physical  (non-cloud-based) servers based at the health facilities for operation, server outage shall be monitored."
"Considering stability is a critical aspect to ensure successful implementation of EMRS intervention, continued stability monitoring processes shall be automated and systems configured accordingly to enable proactive and timely reactive response."
"For instance, the technical fidelity of EMRS (i.e., functionality and stability) and the enabling environment such as any external barriers that might cause it not to function as intended, and compliance of EMRS end-users to stipulated data use and system administration standard operating procedures."
Monitoring fidelity of EMRS intervention shall occur throughout implementation with the required level of effort gradually decreasing depending on the time it takes to identify and resolve issues.
"Standard monitoring procedures and reporting mechanisms shall be established and automated to aid Quality: Refers to the measure of excellence, value, conformance to specifications, conformance to requirements, fitness for purpose and ability to meet or exceed expectations."
6.3 Evaluating the EMRS

(non-research) setting.
"the highest quality possible informed by existing practice, literature and formative research in the local context to increase effectiveness of the EMRS intervention."
Refer to Appendix Jfor a detailed EMRS Deployment Monitoring Framework.
The evaluation shall entail any measures that shall be taken and analysis performed to assess; a) The interaction of users and/or the health system with the EMRS intervention and strategies b) Changes attributable to the implementation of EMRS.
"Any commissioned evaluations focused on EMRS shall be designed to ensure assessment and evidence generation on its usability, effectiveness, value for money and affordability at the very least, depending on the degree of maturity i.e, early or middle or late stage."
"Effectiveness: Assess whether the EMRS achieves the intended results in an uncontrolled Implementation research: Assess the uptake, institutionalization, and sustainability of EMRS in Uganda, including policies and practices."
Formative evaluations: Studies aimed at informing the design and development of effective intervention strategies conducted before or during implementation of an intervention.
Refer to Appendix Kfor a high-level EMRS Evaluation Framework.
"6.4 Dissemination and Adoption of the Guidelines The framework shall guide the collection of information regarding the implementation of the EMRS to facilitate reporting, feedback, and dissemination."
a) Dissemination and adoption of the guidelines The EMRS implementation Guidelines shall be disseminated for adoption through: 1.
Presentation of the guidelines to stakeholders.
2.
Posting of the guidelines on the Mo.
H websites and the electronic Library (Knowledge Management Portal) for access by the stakeholders.
3.
Organising quarterly workshops to train stakeholders and innovators.

6.0 Monitoring and Evaluating the Guidelines This section outlines how e. CHIS deployments and the use of e. CHIS implementation guidelines shall be monitored and evaluated.
6.1 e. CHIS Implementation Guideline Use Monitoring Monitoring the use of the Guidelines for Implementing the Uganda electronic Community Health Information System shall be based on a specific framework designed to track compliance and effectiveness.
"Therefore, the guidelines shall be monitored using three major parameters, namely, dissemination, training, and compliance."
"The guideline-use monitoring framework consists of the parameters or components, key monitoring questions, result statements, indicators, and means of verification."
"Dissemination: Refers to broadcasting the guidelines to a target audience through printed or electronic media such as print, electronic documents, or other forms of media as appropriate."
Copies of the guidelines shall be printed and distributed at national and subnational levels.
The electronic copy of the guideline shall be uploaded on the Health online Knowledge Management Portal for public access and consumption.
Training: Refers to orienting and/or sensitizing key stakeholders on the key components of the guideline document including its value and their roles and responsibilities to ensure awareness and accelerate compliance.
"Compliance: Refers to the state of implementing the e. CHIS in accordance with established guidelines or specifications, or the process of becoming so (compliant)."
Refer to Appendix 11 for a detailed Guideline-Use Monitoring Framework.
6.2 e. CHIS Deployment Monitoring The e. CHIS implementation is anchored within the overall Uganda Health Information and Digital Health Monitoring and Evaluation Framework.
"Findings from deployment monitoring activities shall be synthesized, socialized, and remedial action taken to address identified challenges."
This shall ensure the optimization of e. CHIS implementation across the board and foster successful evaluation efforts.
"Consequently, four key parameters of e. CHIS deployment monitoring shall be considered, namely, functionality, stability, fidelity, and quality."
of verification.
technologies.
"Similar to guideline-use monitoring, the e. CHIS deployment monitoring framework shall consist of parameters or components, key monitoring questions, result statements, indicators, and means Functionality: Refers to the degree to which e. CHIS provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions, or the ability of e. CHIS to support the desired intervention."
"For instance, the desired functionality of the e. CHIS application based on agreed upon user requirements."
Monitoring functionality shall be done pre- and post-deployment to ensure adequate system functionality at all times.
"Pre-deployment monitoring shall entail testing and providing feedback on various aspects including but not limited to skip patterns, validation checks, form schedules, form content, user interface design, data export/import functionality, data accuracy, and dashboard calculations."
Monitoring stability shall be done concurrently with functionality monitoring both pre- and post-deployment.
"Considering that the e. CHIS heavily relies on physical  (non-cloud-based) servers for operation, server outage shall be monitored."
"Considering stability is a critical aspect to ensure successful implementation of e. CHIS intervention, continued stability monitoring processes shall be automated and systems configured accordingly to enable proactive and timely reactive response."
"For instance, the technical fidelity of e. CHIS (i.e., functionality and stability) and the enabling environment such as any external barriers that might cause it not to function as intended, and compliance of e. CHIS end-users to stipulated data use and system administration standard operating procedures."
Monitoring fidelity of e. CHIS intervention shall occur throughout implementation with the required level of effort
timely decision-making.

"Standard monitoring procedures and reporting mechanisms shall be established and automated to aid Quality: Refers to the measure of excellence, value, conformance to specifications, conformance to requirements, fitness for purpose and ability to meet or exceed expectations."
Connect).
e. CHIS quality monitoring shall focus on ensuring (a) data quality and regularity by checking for outliers of non-compliant users; and (b) the quality of content to be delivered is as expected and in line with existing standards and appropriate for participating communities.
Refer to Appendix 13 for a detailed e. CHIS Deployment Monitoring Framework.
6.3 Evaluating the electronic Community Health Information System The evaluation shall entail any measures that shall be taken and analysis performed to assess; a) The interaction of users and/or the health system with e. CHIS intervention and strategies b) Changes attributable to the implementation of e. CHIS.
"Any commissioned evaluations focused on e. CHIS shall be designed to ensure assessment and evidence generation on its usability, effectiveness, value for money and affordability at the very least, depending on the degree of maturity i.e., early or middle or late stage."
The following evaluation components shall constitute the e. CHIS evaluation framework in addition to the Feasibility: Assess whether e. CHIS works as intended in various contexts across Uganda.
"Effectiveness: Assess whether e. CHIS achieves the intended results in an uncontrolled Implementation research: Assess the uptake, institutionalization, and sustainability of e. CHIS in Uganda, including policies and practices."

Introduction
1.1
Context
Health Information System is one of the core building blocks of any health system according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
"The daily business of health relies on information and communication and, increasingly, on the technologies that enable it, at every health service delivery level world over."
"The Ugandan healthcare system, through its ongoing health sector reforms, aims to improve health outcomes."
"As part of these reforms, the developed and is implementing the This was to address the key challenges facing Ugandas health system, set out priorities and key areas on which to focus health investment in the medium term, for both public and private partners, to optimally contribute to the attainment of both the health sector goals and the national goals as outlined in the National Development Plan III."
"The recognises the potential of ICTs in transforming healthcare delivery by enabling information access and supporting healthcare operations, management, and decision-making."
"In light of the above, the Uganda Health Information and Digital Health Strategic Plan 2020/21-2024/25 with a vision of A health sector in Uganda driven by evidence and leveraging digital health to improve efficiency in service delivery."
1.1.1 The Uganda Health Systems Structure Uganda has an organised national health system and health delivery in place within the strategic framework and focus.
The national health system comprises both the private and public sectors.
"The private health sector comprises Private Not for Profit (PNFP), and Private for Profit (PFPs)."
The public sector includes government health facilities and health services of different ministries.

National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - This chapter introduces the concept of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and sets the stage for prioritization of stewardship interventions to address the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials as the major modifiable driver.
The chapter also provides a description of the aims of antimicrobial stewardship in Uganda and insight into the scope of this manual.
Antimicrobial stewardship refers to a coordinated approach that aims to optimize the use of antimicrobials to ensure their effectiveness while minimizing development of antimicrobial resistance.
"It involves various interventions, policies implemented in health care settings to promote appropriate use of antimicrobial agents."
1.2 Situation analysis
1.2.1 AMR in Uganda
guidelines.
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - In 2015, the World Health Assembly (WHA) endorsed the Global Action Plan against Antimicrobial resistance (GAP)3."
The two policy initiatives acknowledged overuse and misuse of antimicrobial as the main recipe for development of resistance.
They also acknowledged need for optimization of use of the available antimicrobials.
"In 2018, Uganda approved the National Action Plan against AMR (AMR NAP) hinged on the five strategic objectives proposed in the Global Action Plan against AMR."
"The strategic objectives include improving awareness and understanding of AMR through effective communication, education, and training; strengthening the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research; reducing the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene, and infection prevention measures; optimizing the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health; developing the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries; and increasing investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines, and other interventions."
"This manual therefore aims to guide the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) encompassing all five strategic objectives, including defining the governance and coordination mechanisms to implement and sustain AMS programs at national and facility levels."
"The burden of communicable diseases in Uganda is still high, contributing up to 75% of the national disease burden, with malaria, acute respiratory infections, and HIV/AIDS among the top 10 causes of illness and death ."
"In 2019, there were an estimated 1.05 million deaths associated with bacterial AMR and deaths attributable to bacterial AMR in the WHO African region."
48% of the AMR burden was attributed to lower respiratory and thorax infections.
"22% of all estimated bacterial pathogen AMR deaths were bloodstream infections, 10% were intra-abdominal infections, and 7% were tuberculosis ."
"In the same year, the number of AMR deaths in Uganda was higher than deaths from respiratory infections, tuberculosis, cardiovascular diseases, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and neoplasms."
There were  deaths attributable to AMR and  deaths associated with AMR .
"Five pathogens have been identified to be the highest contributors to the number of deaths associated with AMR in Uganda: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Typhi."
"These commonly cause lower respiratory infections and all related infections in the thorax, bloodstream infections, and peritoneal and intra-abdominal infections."
"Evidence suggests increasing trends of drug resistance to Watch and Reserve antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, meropenem, imipenem, and tetracycline (among the Gram-negative organisms) in Uganda ."
"This data and information have been used in patient management, the development of antibiograms, and updates to the national treatment Considerable progress has been achieved in establishing the national AMR surveillance program in Uganda ."
"Currently, human AMR surveillance occurs at national and regional referral and in selected public universities."

the
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Standardized monitoring of antibiotic use underpins the effective implementation of antimicrobial stewardship interventions in combatting antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
Uganda has approved national guidelines for monitoring antimicrobial consumption and use.
The implementation of these guidelines at the national level includes monitoring the volumes of antimicrobials imported and distributed for human and animal use.
"27.6% of the total DDDs were penicillins, and 15.5% were sulfonamides."
"Between 2020 and 2021, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the consumption of Watch antibiotics increased by 10%."
"Between 2017 and 2019, most antimicrobials distributed by the central-level warehouses (National Medical Stores and Joint Medical Stores) to public and private-not-for-profit facilities fell under the Access category."
"Additionally, a higher therapeutic density of antibiotics measured in Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per 100 patient days observed at national and regional referral compared to lower-level health facilities ."
Data from routine public and PNFP facility point prevalence surveys and outpatient drug indicator surveys suggest overuse and misuse of antibiotics.
"The proportion of broad-spectrum Watch category antibiotics such as ceftriaxone is high, often prescribed more for the prevention of infections (surgical prophylaxis) than to treat of AMR ; broad spectrum antibiotics are prescribed just in case for diagnoses that dont need require treatment with antibiotics."
"1.2.3 Community use of antibiotics In 2001, Uganda institutionalized a national community health worker (CHW) program at the Health Center Ilevel called the Village Health Teams (VHTs)."
"Led primarily by decentralized mechanisms, VHTs have steered health care service delivery at the household level for decades playing the role of a vital conduit between health facilities and households and delivering high quality and equitable health services to vulnerable communities."
"There is also a vacuum in the policy frameworks and guidance for implementation of concerted community In the societal context of Uganda, how antibiotics are perceived in the social, economic, and political realities of the everyday lives of the people is responsible for irrational medicine use ."

"The IPC practices have been routinely assessed through the IPC mentorship dashboard, with documented outcomes at Various factors such as knowledge gap, limited resources such as IPC materials, personal protective equipment (PPE) and many more have contributed to the poor performance of IPC in Uganda."
"In addition to knowledge gaps, poor attitude towards IPC in the 1.3 Global and National Plans on Addressing AMR Broad global and national policies as well as the more granular facility interventions against AMR are currently focused on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS); a coherent set of actions that promote responsible use of antimicrobials."
"In , the World Health Assembly discussed and agreed to a One Health Global Action Plan focusing on five key strategic objectives: public awareness, infection prevention and control, optimal access and use of antimicrobials, surveillance, and research and development."
"In 2018, Uganda launched the National Action Plan (NAP) , a mirror image of the GAP."
"Under the strategic objective to optimize access and use of antibiotics, the NAP proposes strengthening technical and regulatory frameworks, ensuring the availability of the required medicines, and changing behavior among prescribers."
The appropriate use of antimicrobials requires that the patients receive medicines appropriate to deciding on appropriate treatments for specific the consensus on the optimal treatment options within a health facility or health system.

3.1 Introduction
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - This chapter provides an overview of Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and its role in AMS.
"It also guides on diagnostic stewardship, development and utilization of antibiograms."
Surveillance of AMR refers to efforts to monitor changes in microorganism populations to understand the evolving patterns of resistance to antimicrobials.
"AMR surveillance is achieved through testing The figure below illustrates the relationship between laboratory results generated for individual patient care and surveillance data which are used to inform empirical treatment recommendations and AMR control strategies, including infection prevention and control."

"4.1 Antimicrobial Consumption Antimicrobial Consumption (AMC) refers to estimates of volumes of antimicrobials derived from aggregated data sources such as imports, local manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and stores."
The data collected focuses on the quantity and types of antimicrobials consumed and does not contain any patient information or treatment indication.
"Import data (using Verification certificates, Pro-forma /commercial invoices, certificate of analysis, and declaration forms) Production records of domestic manufacturers (excluding records of any Wholesaler/distributor data."

4.2 Antimicrobial Use
National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - Consumption data presented in DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day provides a rough estimate of the proportion of the population treated daily with a particular drug or group of drugs.
This metric combines two important factors: the total amount of antibiotics consumed and the patient exposure or bed occupancy in a healthcare facility.
This metric provides a way to quantify the amount of antibiotics used per individual patient during a specific time period.
This metric helps healthcare facilities evaluate the average amount of antibiotics prescribed or administered to each patient.
It requires measuring certain antimicrobial use parameters to understand appropriate use or misuse.
Antimicrobial use data also contributes greatly to facility antimicrobial stewardship programs i.e.
"identifying problem areas, setting targets, and evaluating the impact of interventions."

INFECTION PREVENTION
AND CONTROL
"National Antimicrobial Stewardship Manual - This chapter provides guide for a practical, evidence-based approach involving policies, procedures, and activities to prevent harm from avoidable infections for patients and health workers."
5.1 Link between IPC & AMS Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) and infection prevention and Control programs (IPCPs) are separate health system-based programs that share the goal of improving patient outcomes.
"AMS Programmes focus on optimizing antimicrobial use to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, while the IPC Programme focuses on reducing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)."
"By working together, these approaches promote patient safety, enhance patient outcomes, minimizing antibiotic usage hence preserving the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents and reducing the frequency of AMR infections."

"Reduced transfer of resistant pathogens: Proper IPC interventions minimize the transfer of resistant pathogens among patients, between patients and healthcare workers, and between the facility and the community thus promoting the containment of resistant organisms."
Reduction of antimicrobial usage: Antimicrobial resistance arises primarily due to the selective pressure exerted by using antimicrobial agents.
This decreased use of antimicrobials helps mitigate the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
"Rational Use of Antimicrobials: Antimicrobial stewardship programs promote the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents, including choosing the right drug, optimizing dosing and treatment duration, and minimizing unnecessary antimicrobial use."
"This collaboration involves sharing data, conducting joint assessments, and implementing interventions that address both infection prevention and appropriate antimicrobial use."
Drug administration also requires several IPC techniques for patient safety.

"Factors such as; indication of use, dosing regimen, duration of treatment and patient specific factors such as allergies, drug-disease interactions and drug-drug interactions among others."
"Ensuring that patient counselling  emphasizes the importance of adherence to the prescribed regimen, the potential side effects or adverse events and any specific instructions for use."
"Ensuring that health workers dispense the correct antimicrobial as prescribed and properly document the dispensed antimicrobial prescriptions to ensure surveillance of the indication, dosage, duration and susceptibility."
"6.3 Laboratory and diagnostic supplies in AMS The availability of high-quality laboratory supplies and equipment directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic tests, which in turn influences the selection and administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy."
"6.3.1 Rational use of laboratory microbiology supplies Promoting the appropriate use of laboratory supplies within the context of antimicrobial stewardship involves implementing various activities aimed at optimizing the utilization of microbiology supplies while ensuring accurate, reliable and timely results."
The rational use of microbiology supplies refers to the appropriate and judicious use of materials and resources in the field of microbiology testing.
Promoting the rational use of microbiology supplies not only reduces unnecessary costs and resource consumption but also enhances the accuracy and efficiency of laboratory testing.
Proper and Timely Sample Collection: Emphasize the importance of proper sample collection techniques to minimize the need for repeat testing or additional samples.
"Provide clear guidelines and training to healthcare staff on appropriate sample collection methods, transport conditions, and necessary volumes to ensure adequate testing without excessive use of supplies."
Quality Control Measures: Implement quality control measures to maintain the accuracy and reliability of testing.
"Regularly monitor the performance of supplies, such as culture media, antimicrobial discs, reagents, and controls, to ensure they meet established quality standards."
Standardized Protocols: Ensure the availability and use of the standardized protocols for various microbiology tests.

"The quantitative measures for change at each facility will be selected, based on the activities, outputs and outcomes detailed in the AMS Action Plan."
Structural indicators: measure the capacity of systems and processes at the facility to support the AMS program.
Process indicators: measure change due to important processes that contribute to the achievement of outcomes e.g.
number of AMS trainings conducted.
Output indicators: these measure the immediate result of a process: Such as number of IPC Outcome indicators: These measure the impact or overall change brought about by the AMS program; e.g.
5% reduction in volume of Ceftriaxone consumed It is important to note that assessing a large set of indicators is unrealistic; a facility should select the most relevant and feasible measures tailored to its settings.

"The Government of Uganda has consistently prioritized the fight against HIV and AIDS, incorporating it into the core strategies of our national health agenda."
"This framework aligns with our Health Sector Development Plan, the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan, and the National Health Policy."
"HIV Testing Services (HTS) in Uganda have evolved significantly since their inception in 1990, with differentiated models of delivery and policy revisions enhancing universal access, equity, and coverage."
The revised National Certification Framework addresses these challenges by establishing comprehensive standards and procedures for certifying HIV rapid testing sites and testers.
"It outlines the processes for certification, the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, and the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure continuous As we move forward, Iurge all actors in the HIV response in Uganda to support the implementation of this framework."

It is my sincere hope that these certification guidelines for HIV testers and sites will significantly improve the quality of HIV testing services in Uganda and ensure accurate results for all individuals testing for HIV.
"This tool will support the Country Programs efforts to fast-track the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan target of identifying 95 percent of HIV-infected Ugandans and linking them to HIV care and support services, to eliminate AIDS by 2030."
"Finally, we express our gratitude to the following organizations for their financial support of the guidelines development process: PEPFAR/CDC through the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI)."

Introduction
to  sites in 2009.
"This section offers an overview of the HIV situation in Uganda, outlines the history of HIV testing services, and elaborates on the rationale for a National certification framework for HIV rapid testing sites and testers."
"1.1 Situational Analysis of HIV and AIDS in Uganda Ugandas HIV epidemic is described as mature, generalized, and heterogeneous."
"HIV prevalence is 5.8% (7.2% among women and 4.3% among men), corresponding to approximately 1.3 million adults living with HIV in Uganda."
HIV incidence among children years declined from approximately  in 2010 to  in 2020.
"Despite the significant reduction in AIDS-related deaths from the year 2010 to 2020, females aged years and above remain disproportionately affected, contributing to an estimated AIDS-related deaths in 2020."
The young women aged 15-24 years accounted for 79% of all new HIV infections among young people in the same year.
"By the end of 2020, 81% of people living with HIV in Uganda were aware of their HIV status (UPHIA 2020/21)1."
1.2 HIV Testing Services in Uganda HTS in Uganda began in 1990 with Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) as the primary delivery approach.
The country developed its first VCT policy in 2000 to expand HIV testing coverage.
The first policy review conducted in 2005 introduced Provider Initiated HIV Testing and Counselling (PITC) and Home-Based HIV Counseling and Testing (HBHCT) to supplement VCT.
"Consequently, HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) service points more than doubled from 554 sites in 2007 The second review in 2010 separated the HCT implementation guidelines from the HCT policy and aimed to enhance coverage for HCT services to achieve universal access."
"This review also facilitated the introduction of HTS into new programs, particularly Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC), Most at Risk Populations (MARPs), special groups, and quality improvement (QI)."
infections2.
"During this same period, Uganda adopted the strategy and streamlined testing for children and adolescents."
"The increase in the number of testing points, along with the task-sharing of HIV rapid testing with non-laboratory professionals and insufficient supervision, led to several quality challenges regarding the accuracy and reliability of test results."
The Uganda Virus Research Institute is mandated by the HIV-related quality assurance programs and quality improvement processes for HIV rapid testing in collaboration with the Quality Assurance The UVRI quality assurance program initially targeted laboratory professionals.
"However, the decentralization of HIV rapid testing at various testing points involving lay testers created a need to encompass all testers within the program."
"The national HIV External Quality Assessment (EQA) report for  indicates that the Proficiency Testing (PT) pass rate stands at 92.4%, with 7.6% of all testers providing inaccurate HIV test results."
Uganda adopted the WHO recommendation to certify all HIV rapid testers and testing sites as stipulated in the 2016 National HIV Testing Services Policy and Implementation Guidelines3.
"In 2018, Uganda developed its first certification framework for HIV rapid testing with the ultimate goal of ensuring accurate HIV results for every client seeking HTS services, and to date, nearly 25% of sites and testers have been assessed for certification, yielding several lessons learned."
"In 2022, Uganda revised its HTS policy and implementation guidelines, emphasizing the scaling up of national certification of sites and testers to improve case identification in alignment with the attainment of the UNAIDS mandate of by 2030."

"The 2022 National HIV testing services policy and implementation guidelines and Uganda National Health Laboratory Services Strategic Plan , 6 provide for tester and site certification as a key strategy to enhance the quality of HIV testing services."
"However, challenges remain regarding the implementation of quality assurance In Uganda, a standardized national HIV rapid testing algorithm is recommended for use in the diagnosis of HIV5."
"Despite the many interventions put in place to strengthen the quality of testing, it is noted that gaps in quality assurance still exist, as observed in the national support supervision reports as well as the National EQA performance reports During the implementation of the 2018 national certification framework for HIV rapid testing, there is notable quality improvement in both competency and standards of testers and sites, respectively."
"However, quality gaps still exist in HIV rapid testing, as evidenced by the proportion of testers and testing sites that met the certification requirements."

1.5.1 Purpose
This framework aims to:
"This revision, therefore, aims at strengthening the implementation of the framework by addressing the identified challenges, aligning with the current National HTS policy and implementation guidelines, and meeting the requirements for the current HIV testing The certification program will continue to support testing sites and testers in improving and maintaining the quality of testing while leveraging existing resources."
"It will also governance creates an enabling environment for healthcare providers to be accountable for providing quality HIV Rapid testing services and safeguarding high standards of care site and tester certification program will add credibility to testing processes, provide means to ensure and monitor adherence to quality standards, and instill confidence in the results for patient care."
The national certification program for HIV rapid testing sites and testers provides an umbrella under which all aspects of quality HIV rapid testing will be gathered and continuously monitored.
"Site certification, together with regular on-site supervision, mentorship, and site audits, will be used as the key methods to meet and maintain the quality of HIV rapid testing in Uganda."
"Likewise, tester certification, along with standardized hands-on training and ongoing supervision and reassessment to ensure competency, will ensure accurate and reliable HIV rapid diagnostic results."
Quality improvement requires reassessing and addressing current weaknesses across all quality system essentials.
"This document further underscores the need for strong leadership, dedicated funding for quality assurance, advocacy, innovations, and better coordination for continuous quality monitoring and improvement."
"This will result in increased uptake, coverage of quality practices, and access to accurate and reliable test results."
"1.5 Purpose and Objectives The purpose of this document is to provide a framework for planning, designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the national HIV rapid testing certification program for sites and testers."

"Prioritizing community health enhances individual well-being and contributes to the creation of healthier, more resilient, and equitable communities."
"The paradigm shift aligns with the evolving landscape of health policy, emphasizing prevention, collaboration, and sustainability for the benefit of present and future generations."
"that creates solutions based on local social, economic, and environmental factors, closely tied with individual health and well-being."
"Communities play a sub-optimal role in the community health system, functioning more as service users rather than taking an active role in the ownership and management of communityfacing and community-based health services."
"Community health interventions, however, offer the potential for broader and lasting impact, shaping the well-being of entire populations over the long term."

This primary health care facility will serve as the Hub with the parishes within the catchment areas servings the spokes.
the concept of the hub and spoke is useful here in the sense that all delivery of inessential medicines to the last mile come to this facility.
But also this facility receives PHC funds to support PHC activities.
the planning of this facility takes into account the services offered by the CHEWs at the parishes and the VHTs at the household.
"The advantage of F-CAPA concept facility planning for CHEWs and VHTs, technical support supervision/ oversight to the CHEWS and VHTs and other community structures and platforms."
"It also encourages facility participation in PHC activities (in form of outreaches, mass campaigns, home to home visits.)"
"these activities are carried out in form of CAST+, Mass immunization campaign etc."
As all these programs get to be done with support of the facilities it encourages integration.
(Facility Area of Responsibility) Purpose: The Purpose of catchment areas focus aims to ensure that health facilities serve and also empower the people within their area of responsibility and use evidence to deliver an integrated service package through a whole-of-society approach.
Planning for Community Health Interventions will be done at district and sub district.
The implementation will be at the facility catchment area i.e.

Step 2: Prioritization
"Step 1: Annual Health Status Assessment of Sub-county Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment to understand the health, social, and environmental needs of the area."
"Collect relevant data on population demographics, health indicators, environmental factors, existing resources, and community assets."
The assessment will use aggregated data from the following sources: Priority Actions from Parish Development Committees (PDC): Gather input from the committees within the facilitys area of operation.
Community-Led Monitoring Reports: Incorporate feedback from these reports to capture Health Management Information System (HMIS) HMIS 097B: Community Health Report The data will be scored according to disease burden as guided by the current health sector planning and budgeting guidelines for local governments.
"Conduct meetings to agree upon the main health issues, their locations, and their social drivers to collectively address community health conditions."
"In prioritizing, consider national priorities as reflected in policies, the District Development Plan, and respective programs."
Link each problem to its causes.
"This plan will feed into sub county and district annual plans and will form the basis for quarterly operational plans through a micro-planning process, liaising with Parish Development Committees, Village Health Committees and other stakeholders."
"Step 4:  Link with VHT and Parish Plans Develop cross-cutting themes and roll them to VHTs to guide their development of monthly and quarterly VHT meetings, as well as quarterly Village Health plans (Ref: VHT Manuals)."

"Implement a monitoring and evaluation system to track progress, identify potential barriers, and measure the impact of the plan on the community."
Use regular feedback and data analysis to make informed adjustments and ensure continuous improvement of the plan and its implementation.
Step 6: Implementation and Progress Reviews Conduct performance reviews focusing on the previous quarter and year against the plans.
"Develop their capacity to do so by providing opportunities to consult their constituencies, including villages and service users."

"This team should engage all staff, including those in other facilities, extension workers, and Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), to develop a roadmap for F-CAPA in the sub-county."

Outline the steps for clients requiring attention from other providers.
"To achieve the above, map the service providers in the catchment community and establish close linkages to facilitate cross-referral."
"The guiding documents for this will be the PDM pillar IV implementation manual, PHCCE and the integrated community led monitoring guide."
Community involvement will be crucial for transitioning to community-centered integrated services.
"Key stakeholders include village health committees, parish development volunteers, parent- teacher associations, and self-help groups."
"They play prominent roles in mobilizing communities, addressing concerns, monitoring service delivery, and promoting health."
Faith-based organizations offer spiritual and psycho- social support and facilitate referrals.
Parent-teacher associations collaborate with school health teams.
"Communitybased organizations deploy volunteers for health education, distribution of resources, and referrals to local facilities The guideline propose a phased approach starting with a few sub-counties to generate evidence of what works, build local government (LG) capabilities for implementation and monitoring, and create the basis for scaling up to other sub-counties."
"The initiation, targeting and scale up will be guided by individual district implementation plans to meet unique contextual needs and requirements"

"To optimize the programmatic potential of community health, it is generally recognized that multiple systems must coalesce to ensure scalable implementation and equitable coverage."
The intended outcomes of community health to be measured include: Improvement in treatment access and outcomes Reduction in new infections Stronger Community Health systems Community Health Information System (CHIS) Community Health Information System (e. CHIS) at the community level through a collaborative approach with stakeholders.

Community Scorecard
COMMUNITY HEALTH PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
"There are already community scorecard tools in various intervention areas to obtain user perceptions about health services, hold service providers accountable, and ultimately improve the quality of services."
"These tools need to be standardized, and the community score- card process facilitated."
"The National Community Health Strategy (NCHS) sets Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) presented as a Community Health dashboard to help communicate progress made in reducing the disease burden, addressing health determinants, improving population and community health system performance."
The core elements of the performance review and management process include: Production of Quarterly	 community health system performance report against community health performance targets.
"Schedule quarterly community health performance review meetings, including a mid-year and end-of-year review based on CHIS data."
"Analysis and confirmation of performance issues identified during support supervision, including determination of appropriate actions to address the issues."
"Regular performance summary presentations, including identified key issues, provided through the established sub-county and district governance structures."

"Given the that, infections related to poor WASH services in health facilities are among the causes of mortality and morbidity of patients, healthcare workers and visitors to the healthcare facilities, The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 and SDG 6 reinforce the need to ensure adequate WASH services, that will result into reduction in maternal mortality, ending preventable newborn deaths, and providing quality universal health coverage."
"In order to contribute to the above SDGs, Uganda and other partners embarked on the development of the national WASH in Health care facilities guidelines."
"The rationale of the WASH guidelines is to document procedures and provide a framework for strategic planning, implementation of functional and effective WASH services in healthcare facilities in Uganda."
"These guidelines offer a basis of creating the minimum conditions required for providing healthcare services in a healthy environment for healthcare workers, patients and visitors to the healthcare premises."
They also serve as a tool for monitoring the performance of WASH in health care facilities.
address WASH challenges in health facilities to make use of the guidelines.
"The use of a standard approach by MOH and partners will enhance uniformity especially with respect to planning and budgeting, technical designing and construction, operation and maintenance, quality control and monitoring of WASH services in public, private-not-for-profit and private-commercial HCFs On behalf of MOH, Iwould like to thank all development partners for the financial and technical support, particularly UNICEF and Water."

Iwish to extend my sincere thanks to all individuals that participated in the development of the National guidelines for WASH services in Health care facilities guidelines.

contamination of water.
"Functional Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services contribute to improved quality and safety of care leading to reduction in infectious diseases and associated mortality, improved occupational health, staff morale and performance, and increased trust in health care services."
"Equally, recent evidence links improve nutrition to WASH services  access to piped water and reduced open defecation are among factors that led to decline in stunting in Uganda."
"Primary health care facilities are often the first point of care in rural settings and play a key role in outbreak control, which is not possible without appropriate WASH facilities and prevention of According to the 2019 Joint Monitoring Program Report, findings on WASH services in health facilities indicate that, 31 percent of health facilities in Uganda have basic water, 12 percent basic sanitation and 43 percent basic waste disposal."
"In 2018, UNICEF carried out a WASH conditions assessment, including chemical and bacteriological parameters in the water supplied, in 139 healthcare facilities in Karamoja and West Nile Region."
"For instance, in West Nile 85 percent of healthcare facilities had limited water supply due to lack of a reliable water source within their premises and relied mainly on rain water harvesting during the rainy periods."
All (100 percent) of the healthcare facilities do not know of any written guidelines to guide the operation and maintenance (O&M) of WASH facilities.
"Only 2.4 percent of the healthcare facilities had a sufficient annual budget for O&M, 14.6 percent used only internally generated facility revenues for O&Mand only 20 percent had adequate staff for O&Mactivities."
"Finally, 40.6 percent of the healthcare facilities had a functional WASH management committee."

"63 percent had no written guidelines on O&Mand, 5.5 percent had a functional WASH management committee."
"Only 2 percent of the HCFs had a sufficient annual budget for O&M, 14 percent used only internally generated facility revenues for O&Mand 60 percent had adequate staff for O&Mactivities."
"Similarly, in a study done by Water."
"Aid in 2019 together with partners among 63 health care facilities in central Uganda, revealed that 48.1 percent of the health care facilities did not have access to a reliable and safe water supply; 85.2 percent did not have safe and private toilet facilities; 51.9 percent were visibly unclean, 57.4 percent did not have adequate hand hygiene facilities while 53.7 percent did not have an efficient health care waste management system."
69.2 percent had annual planned budgets for the healthcare facility that includes funding for WASH infrastructure; only 61.5 percent had a dedicated infection control focal person or committee; 62.0 percent had written guidelines pertaining to WASH for the healthcare facility; and 36.9 percent had staff responsible for cleaning the delivery room receiving training in the last 24months.
Aid study  covering West Nile and Karamoja.
"In 2017, Water for people together with partners carried out a study on evaluation of water, sanitation and hygiene in healthcare facilities in Kamwenge district in western Uganda."
Of the 63 HCFs visited only 14 (23%) had the exterior adequately fenced with 55% having exteriors free of solid waste and 85% with no visible standing water.
"Of 62 health facilities, 4 (6%) had district or prevention and control (IPC)."
30 (48%) of the HCFs had the main water source was located off the premises with a median roundtrip time to collect water of 30 minutes (range 0-90 minutes).
"Sixteen (37%) of 43 source water samples yielded E.coli, while eight (19%) had turbidity levels >5 NTU."
"Of 113 observed handwashing stations, (88%) had water available, and 64 (57%) had soap."

The source or sources must be capable of supplying sufficient water of acceptable quality for the scheme.
The selection of the most suitable water source involves taking into account a number of general Quantity: Is the quantity of water available at the source sufficient to meet present and future demand?
Water extraction permits from the Directorate of Water Resources Management in Entebbe are required for water abstraction in Uganda.
"Quality: Is the raw water quality such that, water which meets the quality standards specified in the subsequent sections of this guideline."
Drinking water sources must meet the minimum WHO water quality standards.
Cost: Are the capital as well as the operation and maintenance costs of the source Technology: Is there appropriate technology and expertise to exploit and maintain the source of water and associated water treatment and transmission facilities?

"The flushing toilet provides a comfortable, safe and hygienic method of sewage disposal."
The flushing toilet consists of a squat or seat on apedestal panmade of vitreous china or metal and a cistern.
"If people keep using the toilet without flushing it, the toilet pan will fill up with faeces and paper and will block."
If the cistern does stop working it must be repaired as soon as possible.
This begins the flushing process.

This cold air will go down into the pit displacing (pushing up) the hot smelly air upward through the vent pipe.
Dry pit latrines potentially serve as breeding places for flies.
A mesh screen tied at the top of the vent pipe will prevent flies from escaping to the outside of the latrine.
This makes the vent pipe warmer and the heat difference between the pit (cool) and the vent (warm) creates an updraft that pulls the air and odours up and out of the pit.
Fix the fly proof netting to the pipe with glue or tie around with galvanized wire or nylon string.
The mesh size of the fly screen must be large enough to prevent clogging with dust and allow air to circulate freely.
"Clear any debris from the screen, for example by pouring a bucket of water down the pipe, this will also wash spiders and spider webs into the pit."

Segregation must be: Simple to be implemented by all health care workers; Able to guarantee the absence of infectious HCW in the domestic waste flow; Applied in all the HCFs; and Regularly monitored to ensure compliance.
The colour coding system aims at ensuring an immediate uncountable identification and segregation of the hazards associated with the type of HCW that is handled or treated.
"In this respect, the colour coding system shall remain simple and be applied uniformly throughout the country."
"vii)	 The appropriate waste receptacle (bags, bins, sharps boxes) should be available in each medical and other waste-producing area in a health-care facility."
"This allows for segregation and disposal of waste at the point of generation, and reduces the need to carry waste through a health service area."
viii)	 Posters showing the type of waste that should be disposed of in each container should be placed near to the bins (e.g.

Placenta pits allow pathological waste to degrade naturally.
The rest will degrade through a complex and variable mixture of biological and chemical processes.
"At least the top 50 cm of the pit should be reinforced with concrete to prevent surface water infiltration, and its base should be made of concrete to stabilize the structure and to slow the downward movement of liquid towards the water table."
The pit shown in the figure below ( ring with a diameter of about 1 m. The top slab should be above ground level and made of water-tight concrete to prevent surface water infiltration.
"Where soil is particularly sandy, extra precautions may need to be taken to protect the water table and to prevent the pit from collapsing: the sides may be reinforced with bricks, laid with gaps between them so that the liquids can still escape."

Rationale and Approach for Monitoring of WASH Services in HCFs National Monitoring of WASH in HCF shall be accomplished two ways: Routine Reporting Systems These guidelines focus on both the facility assessments and the routine reporting systems.
The monitoring of WASH in HCF in these guidelines mainly focus on: Measuring the level of adherence by the HCFs in maintaining the minimum standards of WASH services as prescribed in these guidelines; Identifying any shortfalls in the O&Mof WASH facilities; Alerting actors at different levels of the needed remedial actions either in the design or construction of the WASH facilities.
13.4.
WASH Services and Facilities to Monitor Monitoring of WASH in HCFs will be on a regular and continuing basis primarily aimed at providing the HCF management teams and other stakeholders with information on the provision of minimum standards of WASH services.

The development of any nation depends largely on the health status of its population.
"Uganda strives to become a middle-income economy, with the health sector providing highquality health care for all through Universal Health Coverage (UHC)."
"One of the objectives safe medicines, vaccines and technologies as well as improving functionality and adequacy of health infrastructure."
The Government of Uganda is committed to improving hypoxaemia management to facilitate the attainment of its overall objective of delivering high-quality health services to all citizens.
The National Implementation Plan for Medical Oxygen Scale-up (2023/24-2027/28) underscores the importance of a holistic approach in enhancing accessibility and availability of medical oxygen therapy services in Uganda.
"The National Implementation Plan for Medical Oxygen Scale-up (2023/24-2027/28) will provide strategic guidance on improving equitable access to quality medical oxygen therapy services, hence promoting oxygen security."
"I, therefore, call upon all public and private stakeholders to tirelessly contribute towards a successful implementation of the National Implementation Plan for Medical Oxygen Scaleup (2023/24-2027/28)."

FOR PERMANENT SECRETARY
ii
The Government of Uganda launched the first ever 5-year National Implementation Plan for medical oxygen scale up in 2019.
This strategic plan formed the basis for effective interventions and played a crucial role in the successful response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Notable achievements during the implementation of the plan include the increased production capacity of oxygen, the establishment of a coordination mechanism, the introduction of a medical equipment inventory management system, the integration of pulse oximetry into the triage process in one out of every four health facilities, and a commitment of over US$20 million in funding from the government and partners for the expansion of medical oxygen services."
Upon the expiration of the initial National Implementation plan for Medical Oxygen Scale-up emphasis on evaluating and reviewing the plan.
This involved developing a new plan reflecting on the lessons learned from the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation efforts undertaken over the preceding five years.
The National Implementation plan for Medical Oxygen Scale-up (2023/24-2027/28) will continue to act as a guide and contribute to a reduction in hypoxaemia-related deaths suffered annually.
"The plan underscores the importance of ensuring medical oxygen security, outlining the strategies to attain this goal."
"These include establishing a National Oxygen sub-committee (NOC), expanding oxygen production capacity, optimizing equipment functionality, promoting public private partnerships, improving oxygen supply chain coordination and accountability, improving oxygen inventory management, increasing access and availability of medical oxygen and prioritizing oxygen for funding under general health budget."
"Achieving the set targets in the plan necessitates a coordinated effort between the public and private sectors, addressing every aspect outlined in the plan through collaboration with the National Oxygen sub-committee at both the subnational and national levels."
"It is hoped that the National plan for scaling up access to medical oxygen in Uganda will guide safe delivery and rational use of medical oxygen across all levels of the health care delivery system and contribute to reduction of morbidity, disability and mortality."
"Therefore, Icall upon all stakeholders to unite their efforts in mobilizing the necessary resources required for scale up of medical oxygen to increase access and availability of medical oxygen to all patients with hypoxaemia"

This implementation plan for medical oxygen scale up will be the basis for development of annual work plans for interventions and activities relevant to strengthening medical oxygen systems.
The implementation of activities will be in line with established mandate and responsibility holders as outlined in the implementation matrix.
"The plan will also inform the annual work plans of implementing partners and other bodies such as NDA, NMS, JMS, MBs, NGOs, academic institutions, health professional bodies and councils etc."
Performance review meetings will be organized by the sub-committee on medical oxygen systems to discuss issues and forge a way forward for any bottle necks encountered during the Progress will be reported in the relevant performance reports such as the Annual Pharmaceutical Sector Performance Report (APSPR).
The sub-committee on medical oxygen systems will establish a suitable platform to collate and highlight progress across the different MDAs on medical related interventions.
The implementation plan for medical oxygen scale up will also be used as an instrument for mobilization of funds for the medical oxygen systems in the next five years.
Activities will be prioritized based on availability of funds.
Annual work planning and timelines will be aligned to the Constitution and the Public Financial Management Act 2015.
"Coordination will be conducted at all levels of the health sector, as well as in the private sector."

"To identify the best equipment, supply mix and other costs necessary to implement a comprehensive and functional oxygen delivery system, each region will need to examine characteristics across all facilities (HCIII, HCIV, GHs, RRHs and NRHs) and oxygen needs."
"This budget specifically projects the costs needed to implement the National Strategy during a five-year period, from 2023 to 2028."
The budget includes both supply costs (Capital expenditure and Operational expenditure) for the oxygen equipment required to maintain and properly use the equipment while also providing the expected amount of oxygen needed by hypoxemic patients throughout these healthcare institutions.
The budget also includes costs associated with implementation of interventions mentioned under each objective above.
"5.2 Medical Oxygen Quantification First, a quantification of oxygen requirements by level of care over the next 5 years was conducted."
The table below shows the national medical oxygen demand in cylinders (6.8) over the next 5 years.

For God and my Country
MINISTER OF HEALTH
"In 1989, the Hon."
"Minister of Health, at the time, appointed a National Advisory Committee on Medical Equipment (NACME) to prepare a policy document to guide acquisition and management of medical equipment in the health sector."
The committee produced the first National Medical Equipment Policy in 1991 which helped both government and non-government agencies to rationalize procurement and management of medical equipment.
"In line with the Presidential Directive issued on 9th , preparation of the National Medical Equipment Guidelines  incorporated international best practices that included; carrying out Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and stakeholder consultations, in order to achieve high quality and low regulatory cost environment."
"The RIA process undertaken by the informed the development of detailed National Medical Equipment Guidelines, to complement and operationalize implementation of existing policies and laws (e.g."
"NHP 2021, National Medical Equipment Policy , PPDA ACT 2003, PPP Act 2015, NDA Act 1993), to ably address the issues of equipment acquisition and management -i.e Equipment planning, acquisition, quality assurance, innovation and improved access to quality equipment, research in appropriate medical technologies, proper equipment use, testing, commissioning, and effective inventory management."
"As we unveil the first edition of the National Medical Equipment Management Guidelines, we mark another significant milestone in our ongoing endeavor to advance our healthcare infrastructure."
"These guidelines represent not just a collection of best practices, but a blueprint for fostering innovation, ensuring quality assurance, and facilitating equitable access to cutting-edge medical technologies."
One of the new developments includes a medical equipment classification and coding system.
"By integrating these codes with existing inventory and e-procurement systems, we shall pave the way for greater transparency, efficiency, and accountability in equipment management."
"Iextend my gratitude to the Chairperson, members of the NACME, and all individuals who contributed to the formulation of these guidelines."
"Together, let us harness the transformative power of modern equipment, to advance the cause of health, and well-being for all our citizens."
Dr. Aceng Jane Ruth Ocero
Dr. Diana Atwine
PERMANENT SECRETARY
"H, coordinated by NACME and HID."
These guidelines are a product of extensive discussions and consultations with various stakeholders including health practitioners from specialized in Uganda.
"They cover the broad spectrum of the equipment lifecycle including acquisition of equipment through Donation, safety of equipment, users, and patients, decommissioning and disposal of equipment."
"equipment rental, placement and hire purchase) including equipment standardization and harmonization to facilitate better maintenance planning, user training and spare parts procurement."
"The guidelines have therefore, been designed to help stakeholders to identify the equipment, its use, composition and minimum performance specifications, safety, and quality standards for Uganda."
"Additionally, proper equipment user and application training must be carried out for the Health Workers, Engineers and Technicians to ensure their proper use, operation, care, handling and maintenance."
"Lastly, Ithank all the members of NACME and the various sub-committees for their time, selflessness, and professionalism during the preparation of these guidelines."

"vailability of sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services is critical to improving quality of health care."
"In recognition of the importance of water availability and good hygiene during childbirth in particular, WASH is considered both a precondition and an entry point for The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 and 6  to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages and ensuring universal access to water and sanitaion for all respectively, emphasize the need to improve WASH in health care facilities that will result into reduction in maternal mortality, ending preventable newborn deaths, and providing quality universal health coverage."
"In order to contribute to the above SDGs, support from UNICEF, Water."
Aid Uganda and other partners embarked on the development of the national WASH in Health care facilities assessment that later translated into the development of the national WASH in Health care facilities micro plan handbook.
"The handbook provides the assessment results, costing to close the WASH gaps in health care facilities and key recommendations."
"and stakeholders as they address WASH challenges in health facilities  to make use of the microplanning handbook to enhance uniformity especially in respect to planning, budgeting, technical designing and construction, operation and maintanance, quality control and monitoring of WASH services in public, private not for profit and private for profit HCFs across the country."
"On behalf of MOH, Iwould like to thank all development partners for the financial and technical support, particulary UNICEF and Water."
Aid Uganda extended towards completion of this task.

UNICEF Representative
Message from the UNICEF Country Representative The period surrounding childbirth remains a critical time in the lives of mothers and newborns.
"While Ugandas progress in reducing under-five mortality has been commendable, maternal and neonatal mortality have decreased at slower rates."
"Improving these numbers will require greater investments, especially in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, which are currently lacking in a full one-third of all public health facilities in Uganda."
"Indeed, the existence of poor WASH infrastructure and weak infection prevention and control (IPC), especially in facilities where women give birth, will continue to put innocent lives at risk."
"Due to the significance of WASH services in health care facilities and the need for reliable data to support planning, resource mobilization, implementation, and coordination among partners, this microplanning handbook for WASH in health care facilities could not come at a better time."
UNICEF will also work with partners to track progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal Targets 6.1 and 6.2 on the availability and sustainable management of water UNICEF extends its sincere appreciation to the its leadership in prioritising the improvement of WASH services in health care facilities across Uganda.

Introduction:
Main findings:
"This National WASH in Healthcare Facilities (HCFs) coverage situational report presents the details of the WASH in HCFs coverage indicators including; access to safe water, sanitation, effective hand hygiene, safe medical waste management and environmental cleanliness as well as the funding gap to close the deficit in accessing those services in Ugandas HCFs."
Aid Uganda using Mwater application.
"View Global Information System (GIS) for processing and scaling to produce maps showing the location of HCFs at national, regional and district levels."
"Large disparities between HCF level, districts, location, regions and ownership regimes sharply existed in access to WASH services in HCFs."
"Across all WASH in HCFs indicators, urban compared to rural, and PNFPs compared to government had better access levels."
Access to WASH services levels improved with improvement in the

Centre Threes (HCIIIs) compared to Health Centre Twos (HCIIs).
The funding gap differ between WASH in HCFs services and level of HCFs.
Access to sanitation had the biggest funding gaps estimated at approximately UGX 367 billion compared to approximately UGX billion for hand hygiene.
"There were also marked disparities between HCFs levels with the funding gap decreasing with an increase in the level of HCFs with HCIIs and HCIIIs with biggest funding gaps compared to HCIVs and In conclusion, the report presents a glaring and dire situation in which Ugandas HCFs are in relation to accessing WASH services."
Support government through the establish and enforce national and international standards (WHO/JMP WASH in HCFs standards 2008) for increased access to WASH in HCFs services.
WHO/JMP standards serve as a basis for establishing national standards.

Support government through the monitor and work towards achieving WASH in HCFs indicator targets.
"Setting targets will help the country to prioritize the most vulnerable HCFs levels, regions, district and service levels and indicators and take into account human, financial and technological capabilities of the country."

The Social Services Implementation Manual - PDM Iam delighted to present the Parish Development Model (PDM) - Social Services Pillar Implementation Manual - a key milestone in ensuring that our citizens actively participate in delivering transformative and yet sustainable development through social services delivery.
"The manual provides information and guidance on how social services are to be delivered right from the parish level to an individual whilst allocating roles and responsibilities to every stakeholder and The implementation of the social services pillar is underpinned by the provisions of: the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (as amended), particularly: National Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy XIII, XIV(b), XVIII, XXI, XXII, XXVII; Articles 17, 23, 30, 32, 34, 39, 176, (2b, d, e and f), 193 and; Sections and 97 of the Local Government Act (as amended)."
"The Third National Development Plan (NDPIII) provisions, especially on taking the government to the people and operating under a whole-of-government approach, inform this pillar."
"The Third National Health Policy; the National Community Health Strategy Opportunities Commission Policy 2006, and; the National Social Protection declarations on Health and Education for all and the AU Agenda 2063 justify the provisions of this manual."
"These Guidelines in so introducing a framework for community social services delivery and, providing information to the users (citizens and officials) prepares them to address the traditional as well as the emerging concerns associated with social services delivery."
Itherefore call upon all citizens and leaders to utilize the manual.

National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies Uganda has experienced several Public Health Emergencies (PHEs) partly because of the proximity to the tropical disease hot spot.
The country needed a strong policy framework to support the development of a sustainable plan for logistics during preparedness for and response to the PHEs.
"In 2005, Uganda adopted the Global Health Security approach to improving logistics during the preparedness and response to PHEs."
"In 2021, Uganda carried out an Internal Multi-sectorial self-assessment to provide an opportunity to measure its progress in improving health security capacities."
The assessment found that the country had limited capacity to activate and coordinate Medical Countermeasures and personnel deployment during PHEs.
The National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies as a core strategy for achieving the Global Health Security Agenda and enabling Uganda to be more prepared to respond to PHEs.
"We call upon the general public, the Government Ministries, and Agencies in the country, Development Partners and the Private Sector to spare no efforts in implementing this National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health"

National Medical Countermeasures Plan for Public Health Emergencies Uganda is a signatory to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 which guide member states to prioritize health security.
"The country has responded to several Public Health Emergencies (PHEs) including the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), Cholera, natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic which has presented serious threats to the Ugandans and Africa at large."
Uganda joined the GHSA in 2013 to strengthen its health security capabilities to respond to public health threats.
"The GHSA has guided the country to prepare, detect and respond to potential public health threats in ways that limit their impact on human, animal ecological health and the socio-economic structure of Uganda also developed the National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS) from the gaps identified in the 2017 Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of IHR capacities."
"In 2020, a review of the NAPHS revealed improved capacities in IHR at points of entry and response to events, evidenced by Ugandas prompt detection and control of the imported EVD and COVID-19 outbreaks."
We envisage that this plan will strengthen the availability and accessibility of logistics and relevant personnel during the preparedness and response to PHEs.
We humbly call upon all the Government Ministries and Agencies (MDAs) to support the operationalization and implementation of the Medical Countermeasures and personnel deployment.
We extend our appreciation to the for its dedicated support in health security implementation in collaboration with relevant sectors in Uganda.

"Over the past two decades, the country has seen a variety of disease pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), yellow fever, cholera and zoonotic diseases (Ebola, Marburg, Anthrax, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) and Rift Valley Fever (RVF), some of Ugandas vulnerability is exacerbated by human pressure on the Great Lakes ecosystem, porous national borders with an influx of refugees and their livestock, migratory wild birds, and globalization of trade and travel."
"Other potential threats include biological, nuclear, chemical, and radiological hazard, natural and human induced disasters."
"Building on IHR 2005, Uganda, as part of a group of 30 countries, launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) 2024 during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in order to accelerate progress to improved prevention, detection and response capabilities."

programs in Uganda.
Information Act
"Currently, health data analytics activities require fetching, integrating and/or triangulating data from different sources using rigorous scientific techniques and advanced technologies."
"Most importantly, timely data sharing, with recognition of the interests of investigators and respective institutions who collect the data, is essential for expedited translation of research results into health policy to improve national and subnational health In Uganda, the generation and use of data for evidence-informed decision-making have been the health sectors priority for a long time."
"The Health Information and Digital Strategic Plan with the objective of maximizing the availability, accessibility, quality, and use of information for decision-making processes."
"This guideline has adopted the Uganda Health Information Exchange and Interoperability Guidelines, the Uganda Health Data Protection, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines, the Data Protection and Privacy Regulations 2020, the Data Protection and Privacy Act 2019, The National Information Security Policy (framework) 2014, The National Records and Archives Act 2001 and The Access to"
2.0 Rationale
3.0 Purpose
4.0 Overall Objective
"The landscape of health data management in Uganda faces significant challenges due to the absence of comprehensive standards for data access, sharing, and use."
"The lack of these standards at all levels of the health system leads to suboptimal utilization of data, breach of personal privacy and confidentiality, and misunderstanding of data ownership."
"In light of these challenges, formulating data access, sharing, and use guidelines is essential to address gaps, enhance data utilization, and ultimately improve health outcomes across Uganda."
"The guidelines seek to establish an effective, transparent, and accountable framework for managing health data access, use and sharing in Uganda."
"By establishing these guidelines, several important aspects will be addressed: a) Maximizing health data use for decision-making b) Improving health data transparency and accountability c) Minimizing duplication of efforts d) Clarifying ownership of health data and information e) Foster a collaborative approach to health data management f) Improving individual health data privacy, confidentiality, and security g) Facilitate collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and healthcare practitioners, fostering a conducive environment for health research."

for Public Health.
"The Government of Uganda through the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in transforming healthcare service delivery in Uganda by enabling information access and supporting healthcare operations, management, decision-making making and policy formulation."
This has been expounded in the Uganda Health Information and Digital Health Strategic Plan 2020/21-2024/25  whose goal is to strengthen the health information system by leveraging digital health to support health service delivery that achieves Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.
"This results in fragmented health records and reports, with each component separate and unlinked from the other."
"The implementation and use of HIE technology have influenced patient care by allowing providers direct access to health information, reducing the time to obtain this information, and increasing providers awareness of patient interactions with the health care system.1 From a broader provider and patient perspective, timely sharing of a patients improve the accuracy of diagnoses, reduce the number of duplicative tests, improve patient safety by reducing medication and medical errors, increase efficiency by eliminating unnecessary paperwork and handling, provide caregivers with Dixon, Brian & Rahurkar, Saurabh & Apathy, Nate."

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report Uganda successfully conducted two rounds of a sub-national polio campaign in the regions of Mbale, Jinja, Soroti, and Moroto, covering a total of 49 districts."
"The first round took place from October 3rd to 6th, 2024, while the second round followed from November 7th to 10th, 2024."
"Both rounds achieved remarkable administrative coverage of over 100%, vaccinating  children in the first round and children in the second round."
"Prior to the campaign, Uganda developed a comprehensive Outbreak Response Plan to address the risks identified through initial investigations and risk assessments."
This plan proved instrumental in achieving high vaccination coverage across all implementing districts.
"Independent surveys, including Independent Monitoring and Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), further validated the strong performance of Iextend my deepest gratitude to the Government of Uganda for their steadfast commitment to safeguarding the health of our children and to the GPEI and other partners for their vital support."
"A special acknowledgment goes to our frontline health workers, whose selfless dedication in the face of numerous challenges made this campaign a success."
This campaign marks a significant step forward in Ugandas journey toward eradicating polio and protecting future generations.
Let us continue working together with renewed determination to achieve a polio-free world.

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report On , 2024, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (c. VDPV2) was detected at an environmental surveillance site in Doko, Mbale City."
"This posed a significant public health challenge, threatening to reverse Ugandas hard-earned polio-free certification status."
It highlighted critical gaps in routine immunization coverage and weaknesses in the surveillance systems.
"Outbreak Response Plan and conducted two rounds of sub-national Polio Vaccination Campaigns across 49 districts in the regions of Mbale, Jinja, Soroti, and Moroto."
"These campaigns targeted children under five years of age, utilizing the novel oral polio vaccine type 2."
"Through the integration of lessons learned from prior campaigns, both rounds achieved remarkable success, with district-level coverage exceeding 95%."
"Round 1 recorded an administrative coverage of 118% ( children vaccinated), while Round 2 reached 127% ( children vaccinated)."
deepest gratitude to our Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners for their indispensable role in planning and executing this critical vaccination campaign.
This initiative has not only likely interrupted the transmission of c. VDPV2 in Uganda but also bolstered population immunity and strengthened routine immunization systems to prevent potential poliovirus importations.
"Special thanks go to the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, CDC, Rotary International, and other invaluable partners for their tremendous contributions to the campaign."
"We also recognize and deeply appreciate the dedication of health workers and vaccination teams whose tireless efforts ensured that all children, regardless of location, received the recommended vaccine."
"Looking ahead, Uganda remains committed to strengthening its surveillance systems, which are critical to the eradication of all polioviruses."
"Together, we can protect Ugandas children and secure a Ag."

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report In response to the detection of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (c. VDPV2), Uganda declared a public health emergency and launched a two-round, house-tohouse polio vaccination campaign in ."
"This campaign, interrupt virus transmission and bolster population immunity."
"To support the implementation of the campaign, Uganda received USD in funds and vaccines totaling  doses for Round 1 and  doses for Round 2."
"Preparatory activities included activating regional Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), supporting district microplanning, verifying cold chain inventory, and conducting preparedness assessments."
"The campaign achieved remarkable results, with  children vaccinated in Round (118% administrative coverage) and  children in Round 2 (127% administrative coverage)."
"Independent monitoring showed coverage of 92% in Round 1 and 96% in Round 2, while Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) recorded 90% in Round 1 and Operational efficiency improved between the two rounds, with Round 1 using doses and experiencing a 2.92% wastage rate (including five missing vials), and Round using  doses with no missing vials and a reduced wastage rate of 2.04%."
This comprehensive approach ensured the campaign's success while identifying areas for future improvement in polio eradication efforts.
Certification Status
in Uganda
Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report Page    91.
Country background Uganda is located in the East African Region.
The total population of Uganda was estimated at 45million as at .
"Administratively, Uganda has one Central Government which as of 2024, is divided into four Regions and 150 districts."
The health system in Uganda operates on a decentralized referral system.
"The Uganda Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), targeting the six childhood killer diseases established in 1980, is now providing 13 antigens."
The African Regional Certification Commission (ARCC) for Polio certified Uganda as free of all polioviruses in 2006.
"However, Uganda was re-infected with WPV in 2009 with a wild polio virus importation, which was effectively controlled with the last case of this outbreak reported to have occurred in  in Mayuge District."
"Since then, Uganda strived to maintain an effective surveillance system and documented that the last polio infection was a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) that had onset in ."
"Following prompt response to this outbreak, Uganda remained polio free until 2021 when new c. VDPV2 were detected from environmental surveillance."
"However, on 27th , the lab confirmed an environmental case from Doko site in Mbale, Eastern Uganda."
2.
This was a major public health challenge that threatened to reverse Ugandas Polio certification status.
This pointed to significant gaps in Ugandas routine immunization coverage warranting a major public intervention.
"Laboratory testing and environmental surveillance revealed the presence of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (c. VDPV2), confirming its transmission within the region."
"The test also revealed that the virus was imported from Kenya Garrisa with 98.78% similarity neighboring Uganda in the East, underscoring the persistent risk posed by cross-border movements."

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report The initial investigation conducted in the outbreak area revealed the following risk factors for the outbreak; Population movement and migration routes Mbale city, located in the Eastern part of Uganda, thrives as a bustling part of Mbale region."
"It not only serves its own district but also acts as a business nexus for neighboring regions such as Teso, Moroto, Jinja and Lango."
"Additionally, it serves as a transit point for various bus and truck companies operating within Uganda and to neighboring countries."
"These companies ply routes to Kenya, South Sudan, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Furthermore, Mbale hosts universities like Bugema students and foreign learners, particularly from Somalia and Kenya."
The foreign student population is dynamic as they may often move in and out of Uganda.
"Alongside the Bagisu, other ethnic groups such as the Iteso, Bagwere, and Sabiny contribute to the citys rich cultural tapestry."
Mapping inaccessible areas and high-risk populations The city has geographically hard to reach areas because of the hilly terrain and poor road access.
"These include Bungokho-Mutoto, Bukonde and Lwasa sub-counties."
"These are located in Bungokho-Mutoto, Nakaloke and The city has a high-water table in the areas of Busamaga, Bukasakya, Namakwekwe, Kikyafu and Kimirembe."
These predispose to contamination of water sources with fecal matter given that the toilet facilities are at the same level with the water table.
Mbale city also welcomes immigrants from various parts of the world.

"Additionally, the Indian community plays a significant role in the citys commercial landscape and usually reside in their business buildings within the city."
"In Uganda refugee populations are also housed in the neighboring districts of Kampala Metropolitan Area, Mukono and Wakiso districts."
Past documented communicable disease incidence and transmission patterns Historical records of communicable disease occurrences and transmission trends indicated recurrent outbreaks of infectious and vaccine-preventable diseases in the region of Mbale.
"Recently, Mbale city grappled with a Cholera outbreak in ."
"The outbreak primarily concentrated in five villages within the city: Masanda (14 cases), Kibiniko (2 cases), Nabitiri (3 cases), and Sisiyi cell (5 cases)."
"Investigations traced the likely source to untreated sewage discharged into river Nakibiso from the industrial park, contaminated water used by residents for domestic purposes."
"In response, the city formulated a cholera response plan, disseminating it to relevant stakeholders."
"Additionally, water samples collected from both the industrial park and neighboring communities in Masanda village revealed contamination with coliforms across all water sources."
"While water guard tablets were distributed to affected communities for short-term domestic water treatment, this measure has not been sustainable."
"In , both Mbale and Manafwa districts faced a measles outbreak."
"Mbale district swiftly developed a measles response plan, albeit hindered by financial constraints they postponed a planned mass vaccination drive."

none of the children was fully vaccinated for the VPDs.
"Measles outbreaks have recently been reported in a total of 19 districts in Uganda, including the two districts within the Mbale region."
"These result in massive loss of lives, crops, destruction of infrastructure such as gravity flow schemes and water supply pipes, property and road network cut off and water-borne diseases."
22 of the health facilities were private.
As of 11th  a total of 20(54%) of health facilities had been visited for active search.

Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report The evaluation of immunization coverage through various assessment methods revealed key insights.
"Administrative data indicated exceptionally high coverage rates, with 111.2% in Round 1 (R1) and 122.7% in Round 2 (R2)."
"However, Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) showed a different picture, with only 33% of LQAS passing in R1 and 66% in R2, indicating significant room for improvement."
"Independent Monitoring (IM) provided more reliable figures, with coverage rates of 93.19% in R1 and 95.17% in R2."
"This highlights discrepancies between reported and actual coverage, emphasizing the need for ongoing quality assurance to ensure accurate immunization reporting Affected sub region: Independent Monitoring (IM) and Lot Quality Assessment In the Mbale District Local Government (DLG), administrative data showed high coverage rates of 131% in Round 1 (R1) and 132% in Round 2 (R2)."
"However, Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) results indicated failures in both rounds, highlighting potential issues in the reported data."
"Independent Monitoring (IM) presented a more accurate picture, with coverage rates of 98% in R1 and 100% in R2."
"Similarly, in Mbale City, administrative data reported consistent coverage rates of 131% for both R1 and R2."
"LQAS results showed a failure in R1 but a pass in R2, indicating some improvement."
"IM figures were consistent at 98% for both rounds, suggesting reliable and steady coverage."
These discrepancies underline the need for continuous monitoring and quality assurance to ensure accurate vaccination reporting.

"Following the declaration of the outbreak in Uganda, the national Emergency Operation Centre (EOC), technical coordinating committee was activated."
"Due to the high virologic risk, gaps identified under the Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance, low non-polio enterovirus (NPENT) rate and low IPV coverage for the 2 years following introduction, high population density in the Mbale region, and high risk of importation from the neighboring countries already infected with the c. VDPV2, Uganda was declared at high risk."
Ugandas response plan was approved for the third option and allocated vaccines and funds to cover two rounds of subnational house to house polio vaccination campaigns to interrupt the transmission of the c. VDPV2 virus.
"This covered 49 districts in the four regions along the Uganda Kenya border that include; Mbale, Soroti, Karamoja and Jinja using the Novel Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (n. OPV2)."

"Rationale & Objectives for the Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Increasing circulation of VDPV2 in several countries and evidence of international spread led to the maintenance of polio as a Public Health Emergency of International According to the GPEI SOPs, any country that detects any type of poliovirus outbreak or event, must respond in a timely and effective manner, with the specific objective to stop polio outbreaks within 120 days (four months)."
"In response to this imported outbreak and its rapid spread, the Uganda Health, in collaboration with key partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, CDC, and the entire Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), launched an urgent Polio Outbreak Response Campaign targeting 49 high-risk districts in the regions of Jinja, Karamoja, Mbale and Soroti that share a border with Kenya."
"The campaign was conducted in two rounds to ensure maximum immunization coverage and protect every child under the age of five and to; Enhance Surveillance for Vaccine Preventable Diseases including AFP: Prioritize focus on the silent districts to improve case detection, Boost Immunization ensuring prioritization of areas with low IPV1 and OPV3 coverage for immunization drives."
Address Zero-Dose Cases: Identify and vaccinate unimmunized children.
Improve Stool Adequacy: Maintain high stool adequacy rates to ensure effective General Objective of the campaign To conduct mass polio vaccination campaign to stop the transmission of the ongoing Specific Objectives of the campaign To vaccinate at least 95% (by LQAS) of Under 5year old children in the 49 districts 2.

"Mbale district in the FY 2023/24 for example, fell in EPI category 2 with a DPT 1 coverage standing at 43%, DPT 3 coverage at 42% and MR1 coverage at 64% (HMIS 2023/2024) because of three categories of factors: Catchment area and population factors: The catchment factors mapped include: (a) The catchment area is big (b) bad terrain, bad roads, bad weather make some places not motorable and make health workers arrive late for outreach."
"On the other hand, the population factors mapped include (a) the urban population served being highly mobile (b) MCH health seeking behavior from TBAs and lastly (c) limited knowledge on vaccination card reading."
"These include outreach implementation gaps, logistical gaps, coordination gaps and RCCE gaps."
(a) Outreach Implementation and Design Gaps: Four implementation and design gaps mapped include: (i) Data led approach to mobilization not embraced everywhere (ii) Data quality gaps with targeted number of children higher than actual number in the VHT registers (iii) Outreach sites are not evenly distributed in some areas or are placed on market days (iv) VHTs selected without following the criteria are inactive (b) Logistical gaps: Six logistical design and implementation gaps were mapped: (i) Lack of all-weather PPE for health workers (ii) lack of EPI Vehicles/motorbikes for support supervision (iii) limited digitalization equipment and poor documentation (iii) limited facilitation for VHTs in Mbale/mobilization by VHTs with the diversion of attention under PDM to parish chiefs (iv) Stock out of vaccines and HMIS tools for FY 2024/25 and l (v) lack of EPI Vehicles/motorbikes for support supervision and (vi) lack of resources to support mass vaccination training and coordination activities.
"(c) Coordination Gaps: Five coordination gaps were mapped: (a) Noncompliance with the PHA 2023 or interaction between the PHA 2023 & registration of persons Act 2015 (part X i.e., national identification register) (b) HWs in PFPFs not following vaccination guidelines (c) corruption (d) under staffing of vaccination team (e) delays in the sharing of lab results with responders (d) RCCE Gaps: Three RCCE design and implementation gaps were mapped: (a) Inadequately targeted specialist led stakeholder engagements have been conducted with hesitant communities and institutions, even those that dont use radios leading to use of force (b) Failure to manage misinformation/Failure to fulfil the 2019 promise to respond to the concerns Njiri 666 raised to parliament and in the Mbale meeting (c) Inadequate IEC materials both in English and local languages: This is affecting all the"

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report Samples of Polio -IEC materials used during the campaign UNICEF supported the HPE&Cmedia agencies, MAAD and TBH, key radio stations were engaged to initially air Polio outbreak alerts and then campaign spots across all regions of the country."
"Additionally, the DHTs also conducted interactive radio talk shows involving service providers, political and toilets with functional soak pits and septic tanks Schools in locations with high water tables should build appropriate steppedup latrines and toilets with functional septic tanks and soak pits Development of IEC materials and printing The initial drafts of various IEC materials were prepared by the Uganda Country Office (UCO-SBC team) in line with the guidelines from the HQs communication team and guidance of the local GPEI partners."
"Following approval by the HPE&Cand printing of the materials, NMS dispatched them to the districts on 24th September until implementation of the campaign."
All the districts received IEC materials prior to campaign implementation.
The SBC teams on polio coordinated distribution of the materials to the lower levels with the DHEs and DCCTs.

The orientation meeting aimed at equipping them with knowledge on polio disease and the campaign and solicit their support for the campaign.
"A total of 64 participants attended the meeting and joined the DHTs in the 49 districts to mobilize communities for polio The community engagement activities were supported by the regional SBC polio consultants with support of DHEs to conduct activities focusing on the Hard-to-Reach/ Serve/Resistant Communities by strengthening linkages between service providers and the hard-to-reach/serve communities in terms of distance from the health facilities, offshore habitats, and poor road network, special populations including nomads, refugees, fishing communities, pastoralists, urban dwellers and the vaccinehesitant/resistant groups."
This entailed identification of such communities in each district through social mapping and support to the DHTs in devising mitigative ACSM plans to engage key leaders/influencers among them.

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report Community engagement also involved the participation of Religious Leaders from churches and mosques as well as cultural leaders to use their structures, including places of worship, and reach out to their followers with the key Polio campaign messages."
The VHTs and LC1s sensitized caregivers while undertaking child registration exercises in the pre-campaign period and also during the vaccination activities.
The DHTs integrated Polio messages in the community dialogue /meetings routinely organized by key EPI implementation partners in some districts before the commencement of the campaign.
This effort allayed any doubts and hesitancy to polio vaccine among community members.
"Launch activities; Uganda launch The polio campaign launch was held in Mbale City at Busamaga playground on 3rd and aimed at officially kick starting and popularizing the sub-national house-to-house polio vaccination exercise, and to increase public awareness about the upcoming house-to-house polio campaign."

Reports collected on ACSM preparedness from districts indicated that 80% of the districts had completed all the planned ACSM activities by the eve of the campaign.
"For intra-campaign supportive supervision, UNICEF and HPE&Cofficials supported the house-to-house Polio campaign and monitored the extent and impact of the implemented ACSM activities."
"Besides checking the teams deployment, essential logistics, and availability of IEC materials, each official visited 3-5 villages and randomly sampled 3 households to engage with the vaccination teams and assess caregivers level of awareness and knowledge on Polio and the campaign."
"The exercise indicated high acceptance of OPV among the parents and caregivers in the community, except for minimal hesitancy in a few areas."
The exercise also revealed that most of the caregivers came to know about the houseto-house Polio immunization campaign through radio and the VHTs.
Conversations around immunization largely remained positive.
"The subsequent week, including the campaign implementation period, recorded a significant increase in volumes and potential impressions, with the social-media influencers further raising overall sentiments and positivity."

"App especially from anti-vaxxers, with a focus on bad immunization experiences and the side effects of vaccination Vaccine hesitancy and refusals."
This led to ACSM level of preparedness being rated low and yet a lot of activities had been implemented on the ground prior to the campaign.
UCC declared Community Audio Towers illegal and this affected mobilization in the communities that use them.
This creates weakness in routine immunization and could be one of the reasons leading to many zero dose and under-immunized children.
Key lessons learned and recommendations for upcoming campaigns Engagement of Events Management team to arrange for the polio launch made work easy and made the event colorful Early implementation of ACSM activities generated overwhelming demand for the service delivery team to cope with in some districts.
Tasking the DHEs to take full charge of the ACSM activities raised their profile and confidence in planning and implementation of ACSM-polio campaign activities.

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report Following detection of a c. VDPV2 at an environmental surveillance site (Doko sewage) in Mbale city, that pose a serious public health threat, partner support, developed a polio outbreak response plan, launching two rounds of polio mass vaccination campaigns targeting children aged 0-5 years in 49 districts in the regions around Mbale City using the novel oral polio virus type 2 vaccine - oral n. OPV2 as recommended by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)."
"The use of the n. OPV2 vaccine reintroduces live attenuated type 2 poliovirus into populations and the environment following the switch from t. OPV to b. OPV (1&3), which poses a risk of the emergence of a new Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2."
It also highlights Government ownership of this process.
The Uganda National Expanded Program on Immunization (UNEPI) chairs the committee whilst the Secretary of the Committee is the in-charge of the Cold Chain Section UNEPI.

Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report The vaccine distribution for RND1 was based on projected target population from UBOS with additional 6% buffer bearing in mind that population dynamics does not necessarily follow the national census projections.
"Due to unpredictable population movements, and discrepancies in population between UBOS projections and actual people on ground, 17 districts experienced vaccine shortages and requested for replenishment from neighboring districts."
"Notably the districts of Butebo, Kibuku, Kween, Mbale DLG and Kapelebyong requested to as high as 6% to 9% additional vials compared to the initial allocation."
"However, all districts reached more children during second round compared to first round and as a result another 11 districts experienced vaccine shortages and this resulted into another inter-district transfer/ relocation of vials."

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report Page    Post- SIAs Coverage Survey In , Uganda undertook a Polio Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA), aiming to vaccinate children under five across 49 districts and 4 cities in Eastern Uganda."
"To assess the quality and coverage of the house-to-house polio Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) campaign, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Sampling (LQAS) method."
"Conducted within five days of the campaigns completion, this survey assessed  children to measure vaccination coverage, community awareness, and the effectiveness of social mobilization efforts."
"However, despite this overall success, 53.3% of districts did not meet the OPV fingermark coverage threshold, with underperformance varying from moderate to severe."
"Notably, only 46.7% of districts achieved the targeted coverage, highlighting a need for focused interventions to address low-performance areas."
"This shortfall suggests gaps in coverage, particularly in districts facing logistical challenges or encountering community resistance, as seen in districts like Busia and Buyende."
"In terms of demographic reach, the LQAS survey achieved nearly balanced gender representation (50% female, 49% male), with an average age of 26.3 months among the assessed children."
"Moreover, the inclusion of infants under 12 months, a group highly susceptible to polio, underscores the campaigns broad and inclusive approach."
"Despite these successes, the campaign encountered several challenges that impacted its reach and efficiency."
"Inconsistent village lists, fading vaccination marks, and occasional errors in finger marking complicated the verification process in areas like Bududa and Soroti."
"Remote districts such as Kapelebyong and Moroto also experienced access difficulties due to their challenging terrains, which led to delays and reduced vaccination coverage."
"Additionally, logistical setbacks, such as delays in transport and per diem payments, affected team morale and timing, especially in"

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report To address these challenges and improve the effectiveness of future SIAs, three key recommendations are proposed."
This would reduce delays and help vaccination teams reach all targeted areas.
Uganda continues to face the threat of polio outbreaks despite extensive interventions aimed at halting the virus's spread.
The virus spreads through the fecal-oral route and aerosol droplets.
Vaccination remains the most effective measure to prevent infection and ensure the health and well-being of children.
"To mitigate the risk of outbreaks, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) recommends countries conduct Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIAs) targeting high-risk areas and populations, in addition to routine immunizations."
"Uganda has implemented SIAs since 1996, targeting children aged 0-59 months with additional polio vaccines to boost population immunity."
"In , Uganda launched a polio vaccination campaign targeting children in districts across the Busoga, Bugisu, Bukedi, Teso, Sebei, and Karamoja regions."
"Additional goals included achieving a Non-Polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis (NPAFP) rate of at least 3 per  among children under 15 years, mitigating the risks of paralytic"

"To assess the quality and coverage of the house-to-house polio SIAs, the World Health Organization conducted Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) surveys in all 49 districts that implemented the SIA."
These surveys aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign and identify areas needing improvement.
"Despite these efforts, the detection of c. VDPV2 in environmental samples underscores the need for continued vigilance and robust immunization strategies to maintain Uganda's polio-free status."

"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report The median number of OPV doses received from birth among assessed children was five doses, indicating that half of the children received five or more doses."
"The range of doses varied from 1 to 8, with 51.2% of children receiving five or more doses."
"However, 10.7% received fewer than three doses, suggesting a gap in vaccination coverage for a small segment of the population."
"Districts such as Busia, Buyende, and Kamuli exhibited 16.7% of children with fewer than three doses, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to increase vaccine coverage in these areas."
"At the regional level, Soroti and Jinja reported the highest proportions of children with lower dose coverage, underlining the importance of focused outreach and support."
"Conversely, Moroto District recorded the highest overall number of OPV doses administered, reflecting effective vaccination coverage and adherence to protocols in Factors influencing OPV dose intake."

AWARENESS OF POLIO SIAS
High-Awareness Regions
"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report In preparation for the  Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA), an extensive awareness campaign was conducted to engage local leaders, health workers, and other key stakeholders."
Four districts.
"Moroto, Amuria, Bukedea, and Katakwiachieved 100% caregiver awareness."
"This level of awareness likely reflects strong community mobilization efforts by local leaders, health workers, and outreach teams."
"High awareness in these areas suggests that the messaging and communication strategies effectively reached and engaged caregivers, preparing them for the arrival of vaccination teams."
"Top Awareness Levels Among Large Districts Among larger districts, Soroti led with 96.2% awareness, followed closely by Moroto at 93.1% and Mbale at 92.4%."
These high percentages demonstrate successful engagement and preparedness in areas where a substantial proportion of children needed to be reached.
"The high awareness rates in these districts are likely due to the combination of radio broadcasts, community leader involvement, and volunteer efforts that effectively conveyed the campaign's importance."

Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report Recommendations were mainly extracted from District reports submitted to the DHT to immediately update micro plan for administrative structures to inform appropriate funding for round 2 Bio stat should work with National and District VAM to harmonize vaccine District EPI focal person should follow up data cleaning and development of an electronic payment sheet for all participants DHO to support submission of list of missing villages and other administrative structures core to implementation to World Health Organization.
"District EPI FP should follow up implementation of facility strategies for reaching the Zero dose children by all facilities DCCT should hold on with returning the borrowed vaccine careers till end of Determine number of teams according to number villages in the district ensuring that each team is allocated a maximum of 2 villages for the entire implementation Increase Fuel rates for sub county supervisors Ensure fuel budgeted is adequately reflected on the fuel cards Provide Apron for teams for identification during implementation Frontline Implementers recommended that the centrally controlled online payment reimbursed system should be maintained as it re-assures them of their ideal payment rates than when their allowances are reimbursed by the district For effective training, 2 days should be allocated for future campaigns to avoid brain overload in a single day There is need to provide airtime and data bundles during implementation period for easy communication and timely reporting Allocation of vaccines for Round II should be based on actual number of registered children to avoid stock outs during vaccination (some districts received more The budgeting process should be Bottom-Top to ensure adequate resources based on actual number of registered children, therefore for Round II there is need to add number of teams Budget for T-shirts for the subsequent campaigns Registration of children needs to be done a month prior to implementation for"

Conclusion
"Uganda Polio Outbreak Response Campaign Report proper planning based on numbers and figures are used instead of relying on The budget for the Islands needs to be honored since the WHO Regional Coordinator fully participated in the budgeting process and consider a per diem for the District Supervisors and risk allowance for other teams The mobilization budget for district leaders should also cater for their movement to the Sub counties on the Islands There is need to include Radio Talk shows in the budget Lower Local Councils should be fully involved throughout implementation Need to Budget for 1 indelible marker per village Districts to procure for their own chalk which will be of quality and not get broken In order to minimize   high wastages, the vaccine vial size should be reduced from 50 dozes to at least 10 dozes per vial."
"Generally, the districts registered excellent performance in terms of coverage at the end of campaign."

"The World health statistics report is the annual compilation of health and health-related indicators, which has been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2005."
"WHOs Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact produces this report, in collaboration with WHO technical regional and country offices."
The 2024 edition reviews more than 50 health-related indicators from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and WHOs Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13).
"The report consists of four chapters, complemented by tables presenting the latest available Chapter 1 presents updated global and regional estimates of life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, and mortality from specific causes, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demographic and epidemiological profiles."
Chapter 2 summarizes global and regional trends in the health-related SDGs.
Chapter 3 presents the latest update on WHOs Triple Billion target within the GPW13.
"And Chapter 4 looks at important global health issues, including the double burden of malnutrition, disability-related health inequities, and the health of refugees and migrants."

"In just two years, the COVID-19 pandemic reversed over a decade of gains in both life expectancy at birth and healthy life expectancy (HALE)."
"By 2020, both global life expectancy and HALE had rolled back to 2016 levels (72.5years and 62.8 years, respectively)."
"The following year saw further declines, with both retreating to 2012 levels (71.4 years and 61.9 years, respectively)."
"The Western Pacific Region saw the smallest impacts over the first two pandemic years, with losses of less than 0.1 and 0.2 years in life expectancy Globally, the share of deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among all deaths rose steadily to 73.9% by 2019, while the share of communicable diseases dropped to 18.2%."
"With the emergence of COVID-19, communicable diseases surged back to 23.0% of all deaths in 2020 and 28.1% in 2021  a return to 2005 levels."
"Consequently, the share of NCD deaths declined to 70.0% COVID-19 ranked among the top three leading causes of death globally in 2020 and 2021, responsible for 4.1million and 8.8 million lives lost, respectively."
"Among the health-related indicators included in this report, 32have numeric SDG or global targets."
But acceleration across all three areas is needed to achieve broader health-related SDGs by 2030.
"The world continues to grapple with the double burden of malnutrition, characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition and overweight/obesity."
"This report also highlights health challenges faced by persons with disabilities, and refugees and migrants."
"Globally, in 2021, an estimated 1.3billion people (16% of the population) had disability and faced health inequities due to avoidable, unfair and unjust factors."
Progress requires strengthening health systems that integrate targeted actions to increase equity.
Lack of quality data further obstructs understanding of their needs and tracking progress on health goals.
The report serves as a crucial reminder that todays health systems must swiftly adapt to respond to changing demographics and persisting inequities.

"However, the region experienced some losses (0.3 years in life expectancy and 0.3 years in HALE) in 2021 compared with 2020, that cancelled out the earlier gains ."
The scale of pandemic-related tolls also varied over time across regions.
"The Region of the Americas, the European Region and the Eastern Mediterranean Region all experienced more severe impact in the first pandemic year, with 2020 seeing at least two thirds of the life expectancy decline and three fifths of the HALE decline."
"In contrast, coinciding with the wider spread of the Delta variant, the decline in life expectancy and HALE in the African and South-East Asia regions occurred more predominantly in 2021, accounting for at least 65% of the total losses in (Fig."

"The European Region, which had the highest share of NCD deaths among all deaths in 2019 (89.6%), experienced an abrupt shift of disease burden back to communicable diseases in 2020 and 2021, as the share of NCD deaths dropped to 75.9% in 2021 and the share of communicable diseases nearly quadrupled from 5.3% in 2019 to 20.0% in 2021."

The South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions also saw ASDR from communicable diseases more than doubled in the same period.
"Limited impact was seen in ASDR from these two groups of cause of death in compared with that from communicable Similar trends were observed across all World Bank income groups, with sizable reductions observed in ASDR for all three broad cause categories in and little excess change brought by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 for NCDs and injuries."

"Globally, five of the 10 leading causes in 2000 were communicable and four were NCDs, with road injury being the only injury cause (Fig."
1.7).
"In 2019, communicable diseases continued to take up seven of the top 10 causes of deaths along with two NCDs and one injury in the African Region and low-income countries ."
"With communicable diseases being effectively prevented or treated, and populations surviving to older ages where NCDs become the predominant risk, NCDs already accounted for nine of the top 10 causes in 2019 in the European Region and the Western Pacific Region (Fig.1.8), as well as in upper-middle-income and highincome countries (Fig."

The decline in the global number of deaths corresponds to a 17% decline from the crude death rate (CDR) due to road traffic injuries (SDG indicator 3.6.1) from 17.9 (UI: 16.019.8) deaths per 100000 population in 2010 to 14.9 (UI: 13.316.4) deaths per 100000 population in 2021.

"The WHO End TB strategy calls for a 50% reduction of TB incidence rate by 2025 relative to the 2015 baseline, as a milestone towards the SDG 2030 and End TB 2035 targets ."
"While TB incidence rate had continuously declined for many years up to 2020, two consecutive years of global increases in TB incidence (in 2021 and 2022) led to the TB incidence rate in 2022 reverting to the level of 2019."

"The global malaria incidence rate (malaria cases per 1000 population at risk, SDG indicator 3.3.3) was 59.8 (UI: 54.865.7) in 2015, having declined by 26% from 81.0 (UI: 75.787.7) in 2000."
"The incidence rate continued to fall until 2019, before rising by 3% in 2020 and remaining stable since."
The WHO African Region continues to bear the heaviest burden of malaria.
"In 2022, the region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of global malaria deaths."
WHO recently added the programmatic use of malaria vaccines for children living in endemic areas to the malaria prevention toolbox.
"In 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21-Matrix-M (R21) ."
Findings from the pilot programme informed the historic WHO recommendation in  for a vaccine to prevent malaria in children.
"Over 2 million children received the RTS,Smalaria vaccine through the pilot."
"Findings from MVIP show that the RTS,Svaccine substantially reduces early childhood deaths and In , WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21, for routine use."
"This recommendation, resulting in sufficient vaccine supply to scale up malaria vaccines broadly, coupled with the high impact seen with the introduction of the RTS,Svaccine, underscores the potential of malaria vaccines as important interventions to act against Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa, and further supports the case for implementing the malaria vaccine as a routine child The wide-scale implementation of the malaria vaccines, which began in early 2024, holds the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year."
"Key findings: substantial public health impact Disease surveillance during 46 months of RTS,Svaccine use and scale-up, as part of the MVIP, showed that malaria vaccine introduction resulted in a 13% vaccine-attributable reduction in all-cause mortality (excluding injury) among children age-eligible for vaccination compared with children living in areas where the vaccine was not in use."

"The year-to-year change of HPOP contribution was 407million from 2018 to 2019, but was only 237million from 2019 to 2020, followed by 198million in 2021 and 186million in 2022."

"Capacity limitations of health information workers (HIW) often hinder the ability to effectively produce and use health data, despite significant improvements in health information systems."
HIWs often do not possess the required capacities to participate consistently and in a timely manner in the data management cycle.
"To systematically assess such capacity gaps, the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, with support from WHO organizations, launched the DMCF in  ."
This tool will enable health information managers in countries to identify capacity gaps and plan and drive the competency development of their HIWs across different levels of their health system.
"As a direct outcome of a national health information workshop held in , Papua New Guinea National collaborated with WHO to establish a standardized set of competencies required for health information positions at both national and provincial levels based on the ideally required skills and competencies spelled out in the WHO DMCF."
China followed suit by identifying the frameworks value in improving health information workforce capacity in a systematic and sustainable manner.
The Center for Health Statistics and Information of the National Health Commission of China collaborated with WHO in translating the framework into Chinese and conducted a series of workshops at both national and provincial levels in preparation for conducting competency gap assessments among different types of health workers across different provinces.
"The adoption of the framework in Papua New Guinea and China serves as pivotal examples, highlighting how the WHO DMCF could be applied to each Member States unique context."

"Today, the world faces the double burden of malnutrition, characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity within individuals, households and populations, and across the life course."
"This section highlights the global and regional trends in the population-level burden of stunting, wasting and overweight among children under 5years of age, and the double burden of thinness or underweight and obesity among older children, adolescents and adults."
Box 4.1 summarizes the definitions of the indicators of malnutrition used in Child stunting stems from poor nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood.
"Undernutrition, as measured by thinness among children aged 519 years, lowers learning potential, weakens the immune system, and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality."
Micronutrient deficiencies and anaemia in adolescent girls amplify the risk of life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
"In turn, ageing brings physiological changes with sensory impairment, poor oral health, isolation, loneliness and depression, which further exacerbate the Box 4.1	 Definitions of metrics and measures used in this section For children under 5years of age: Stunting: height-for-age lower than 2 standard deviations below WHO Child Growth Standards median Wasting: weight-for-height lower than 2 standard deviations below WHO Child Growth Standards median Overweight: weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth For children and adolescents aged 519 years: Thinness: BMI-for-age lower than 2 standard deviations below the WHO Growth Reference median Obesity: BMI-for-age greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median."

The ARR (5.5% per year) substantially surpasses that in the Region of the Americas (2.0% per year) as well as in the upper-middle-income countries (3.1% per year) (Fig.
4.2) .
"An analysis of drivers of the decline in stunting prevalence in Peru from 2000 to 2016 identified multiple determinants of stunting reduction, including socioeconomic class, parental education, parental health, and differences in maternal and newborn health care."
"Reducing the equity gap contributed greatly to this reduction, with the greatest reductions observed in the lowest wealth quintile, in rural areas and among children with the least-educated mothers."
"The slope index of inequality, a measure of absolute wealth-related inequality, indicates that the gap in stunting prevalence among children under 5 years of age between the richest and poorest households reduced by half between 2000 and 2016, leading to greater equity."
